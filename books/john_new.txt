JOHN
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CHAPTER 1
Jn 1:1	In da beginning wuz da Word, n da Word wuz w God, n da Word wuz God.
Jn 1:2	Dis 1 wuz in da beginning w God.
Jn 1:3	All tingz came into bein’ thru him, n apart from him not 1 thang came into bein’ dat’s come into bein’.
Jn 1:4	In him wuz lyf, n da lyf wuz da light of humanity.
Jn 1:5	And da light shines in da darkness, n da darkness didn't overcome it. 

Jn 1:6	A man came, sent from God, whose name wuz Johnny.
Jn 1:7	Dis 1 came 4 a witness, so dat he could testify 'bout da light, so dat all would believe thru him.
Jn 1:8	Dat 1 wasn’t da light, but came so dat he could testify 'bout da light.
Jn 1:9	Da tru light, who gives light 2 every person, wuz comin’ into da world.
Jn 1:10	He wuz in da world, n da world came into bein’ thru him, n da world didn't recognize him.
Jn 1:11	He came 2 his own tingz, n his own ppl didn't get him.
Jn 1:12	But as many as received him--2 those who believe in his name--he gave 2 them authority 2 become kids of God,
Jn 1:13	who were born not of blood, nor of da will of da flesh, nor of da will of a husband, but of God. 

Jn 1:14	And da Word became flesh n took up rez among us, n we saw his glory, glory as of da 1 n only from da Dad, full of grace n truth.
Jn 1:15	Johnny testified 'bout him n cried out, sayin’, "Dis 1 wuz he 'bout whom i said, 'Da 1 who comes after me is ahead of me, cuz he existed b4 me.'"
Jn 1:16	Cuz from his fullness we've all received, n grace after grace.
Jn 1:17	Cuz da law wuz given thru Moe; grace n truth came 'bout thru JC.
Jn 1:18	No 1 haz seen God at any time; da 1 n only, God, da 1 who is in da bosom of da Dad--dat 1 haz made him known. 

Jn 1:19	And dis is da testimony of Johnny, when da Jews sent priests n Levites from Jerusalem so dat they could ask him, "Who r u?"
Jn 1:20	And he confessed--n he didn't deny, n confessed--"i ain’t da Christ!"
Jn 1:21	And they asked him, "Then who r u? R u Elijah?" And he said, "i ain’t!" "R u da Prophet?" And he answered, "No!"
Jn 1:22	Then they said 2 him, "Who r u, so dat we can give an answer 2 those who sent us? Wut do u say 'bout yoself?" 

Jn 1:23	He said, 
 "im 'da voice of 1 crying out in da wilderness, "Make straight da wae of da Lord," '
 just like Isaiah da prophet said."
Jn 1:24	(And they had been sent from da Pharisees.)
Jn 1:25	And they asked him n said 2 him, "Y then r u baptizin’, if u aren’t da Christ, nor Elijah, nor da Prophet?" 

Jn 1:26	Johnny answered them, sayin’, "i baptize w water. In yo midst stands 1 whom u dunno--
Jn 1:27	da 1 who comes after me, of whom i ain’t worthy 2 untie da strap of his sandal!"
Jn 1:28	Deez tingz took place in Bethany on da other side of da Jordan, where Johnny wuz baptizin’. 

Jn 1:29	On da next day he saw Jesus comin’ 2 him n said, "Look! Da Lamb of God who takes away da sin of da world!
Jn 1:30	Dis 1 is da 1 'bout whom i said, 'After me is comin’ a man who is ahead of me, cuz he existed b4 me.'
Jn 1:31	And i didn't kno him, but so dat he could be revealed 2 Israel, cuz of dis i came baptizin’ w water." 

Jn 1:32	And Johnny testified, sayin’, "i’ve seen da Spirit goin’ down like a dove from heaven n remaining on him.
Jn 1:33	And i didn't kno him, but da 1 who sent me 2 baptize w water, dat 1 said 2 me, 'Da 1 on whom u c da Spirit goin’ down n remaining on him--dis 1 is da 1 who baptizes w da Holy Spirit.'
Jn 1:34	And i’ve seen n testify dat dis 1 is da Chosen 1 of God. 

Jn 1:35	On da next day again Johnny wuz standing there, n 2 of his homeboys,
Jn 1:36	n looking at Jesus as he wuz walking by, he said, "Look! Da Lamb of God!"
Jn 1:37	And da 2 homies heard him talkin’, n they followed Jesus.
Jn 1:38	And Jesus, turning around n seeing them following him, said 2 them, "Wut do u seek?" And they said 2 him, "Rabbi" (which means when translated "Teacher"), "where r u stayin’?"
Jn 1:39	He said 2 them, "Come n u will c!" So they came n saw where he wuz stayin’, n they stayed w him dat day ('twas 'bout da 10th hr). 

Jn 1:40	Andrew, da bro of Simon Pete, wuz 1 of da 2 who heard Johnny n followed him.
Jn 1:41	Dis 1 1st found his own bro Simon n said 2 him, "We hav found da Messiah!" (which is translated "Christ").
Jn 1:42	He brought him 2 Jesus. Looking at him, Jesus said, "U r Simon da son of Johnny. U gonna be called Cephas" (which is interpreted "Pete"). 

Jn 1:43	On da next day he wanted 2 depart 4 Galilee, n he found Phil. And Jesus said 2 him, "Follow me!"
Jn 1:44	(Now Phil wuz from Bethsaida, da town of Andrew n Pete.)
Jn 1:45	Phil found Nathanael n said 2 him, "We hav found da 1 whom Moe wrote 'bout in da law, n da prophets wrote 'bout--Jesus son of Joey from Nazareth!"
Jn 1:46	And Nathanael said 2 him, "Can anythin’ gud come out of Nazareth?" Phil said 2 him, "Come n c!" 

Jn 1:47	Jesus saw Nathanael comin’ toward him n said 'bout him, "Look! A tru Israelite in whom is no deceit!"
Jn 1:48	Nathanael said 2 him, "From where do u kno me?" Jesus answered n said 2 him, "B4 Phil called u, when u were under da fig tree, i saw u."
Jn 1:49	Nathanael answered him, "Rabbi, u r da Son of God! U r da king of Israel!"
Jn 1:50	Jesus answered n said 2 him, "Cuz i said 2 u dat i saw u under da fig tree, do u believe? U will c better tingz than deez!"
Jn 1:51	And he said 2 him, "Fr, fr i tell all of u, u will c heaven opened n da angels of God goin’ up n goin’ down on da Son of Man." 


CHAPTER 2
Jn 2:1	And on da 3rd day, there wuz a wedding at Cana in Galilee, n da mom of Jesus wuz there.
Jn 2:2	And both Jesus n his homeboys were invited 2 da wedding.
Jn 2:3	And when da wine ran out, da mom of Jesus said 2 him, "They hav no wine!"
Jn 2:4	And Jesus said 2 her, "Wut does yo concern hav 2 do w me, woman? My hr hasn't yet come."
Jn 2:5	His mom said 2 da servants, "Whatever he says 2 u, do it!" 

Jn 2:6	Now 6 stone water jars were set there, in accordance w da ceremonial cleansing of da Jews, each holding 2 or 3 measures.
Jn 2:7	Jesus said 2 them, "Fill da water jars w water." And they filled them 2 da brim.
Jn 2:8	And he said 2 them, "Now draw some out n take it 2 da head steward. So they took it.
Jn 2:9	Now when da head steward tasted da water which had become wine n didn't kno where 'twas from--but da servants who had drawn da water knew--da head steward summoned da bridegroom
Jn 2:10	n said 2 him, "E’erybody serves da gud wine 1st, n whenever they’re drunk, da inferior. U hav kept da gud wine until now!"
Jn 2:11	Dis beginning of signs Jesus performed at Cana in Galilee, n revealed his glory, n his homeboys believed in him. 

Jn 2:12	After dis he went down 2 Capernaum, n his mom n bros n his homies, n they stayed there a few days.
Jn 2:13	And da Passover of da Jews wuz near, n Jesus went up 2 Jerusalem. 

Jn 2:14	And he found in da temple courts those who were selling oxen n sheep n doves, n da money changers seated.
Jn 2:15	And he made a whip of cords n drove them all out of da temple courts, both da sheep n da oxen, n he poured out da coins of da money changers n overturned their tables.
Jn 2:16	And 2 da ones selling da doves he said, "Take deez tingz away from here! Don’t make my Dad's house a marketplace!"
Jn 2:17	His homies remembered dat it’s written, "Zeal 4 yo house will consume me." 

Jn 2:18	So da Jews answered n said 2 him, "Wut sign do u show 2 us, cuz u r doin’ deez tingz?"
Jn 2:19	Jesus answered n said 2 them, "Destroy dis temple, n in 3 days i’ll raise it up!"
Jn 2:20	Then da Jews said, "Dis temple haz been under construction 46 yrs, n will u raise it up in 3 days?"
Jn 2:21	But he wuz talkin’ 'bout da temple of his body.
Jn 2:22	So when he wuz raised from da ded, his homies remembered dat he had said dis, n they believed da scripture n da sayin’ dat Jesus had spoken. 

Jn 2:23	Now while he wuz in Jerusalem at da Passover, during da feast, many believed in his name cuz they saw his signs which he wuz doin’.
Jn 2:24	But Jesus himself didn't entrust himself 2 them, cuz he knew all ppl,
Jn 2:25	n cuz he didn't need anyone 2 testify 'bout man, 4 he himself knew wut wuz in man. 


CHAPTER 3
Jn 3:1	Now there wuz a man of da Pharisees whose name wuz Nicodemus, a ruler of da Jews.
Jn 3:2	Dis man came 2 him at night n said 2 him, "Rabbi, we kno dat u r a teacher who haz come from God, 4 nobody is able 2 perform deez signs dat u r performing unless God were w him."
Jn 3:3	Jesus answered n said 2 him, "Fr, tbh, unless someone’s born from above, he’s not able 2 c da kingdom of God."
Jn 3:4	Nicodemus said 2 him, "How can a man be born when he’s an old man? He isn’t able 2 enter into his mom's womb 4 da 2nd time n be born, can he?" 

Jn 3:5	Jesus answered, "Fr, tbh, unless someone’s born of water n spirit, he’s not able 2 enter into da kingdom of God.
Jn 3:6	Wut is born of da flesh is flesh, n wut is born of da Spirit is spirit.
Jn 3:7	Don’t be shook dat i said 2 u, 'It’s necessary 4 u 2 be born from above.'
Jn 3:8	Da wind blows wherever it wishes, n u hear da sound of it, but u dunno where it comes from n where it’s goin’. So is e’erybody who is born of da Spirit." 

Jn 3:9	Nicodemus answered n said 2 him, "How can deez tingz be?"
Jn 3:10	Jesus answered n said 2 him, "R u da teacher of Israel, n u don’t understand deez tingz?
Jn 3:11	Fr, tbh, we talk wut we kno, n we testify 'bout wut we've seen, n u don’t accept our testimony!
Jn 3:12	If i tell u earthly tingz n u don’t believe, how’ll u believe if i tell u heavenly tingz?
Jn 3:13	And nobody haz gone up into heaven except da 1 who went down from heaven--da Son of Man.
Jn 3:14	And just like Moe lifted up da snek in da wilderness, so it’s necessary dat da Son of Man be lifted up,
Jn 3:15	so dat e’erybody who believes in him will hav lyf 4ever." 

Jn 3:16	Cuz in dis wae God luvd da world, so dat he gave his 1 n only Son, so dat e’erybody who believes in him won’t die, but will hav lyf 4ever.
Jn 3:17	Cuz God didn't send his Son into da world so dat he shud judge da world, but so dat da world shud be saved thru him.
Jn 3:18	Da 1 who believes in him isn’t judged, but da 1 who doesn't believe haz already been judged, cuz he hasn't believed in da name of da 1 n only Son of God.
Jn 3:19	And dis is da judgment: dat da light haz come into da world, n ppl luvd da darkness rather than da light, cuz their deeds were bad.
Jn 3:20	Cuz e’erybody who practices bad hates da light n doesn't come 2 da light, lest his deeds be exposed.
Jn 3:21	But da 1 who practices da truth comes 2 da light, so dat his deeds may be revealed, dat they’re done in God. 

Jn 3:22	After deez tingz Jesus n his homeboys came into Judean territory, n there he spent time w them n wuz baptizin’.
Jn 3:23	Now Johnny wuz also baptizin’ at Aenon near Salim, cuz water wuz plentiful there, n they were comin’ n were bein’ baptized.
Jn 3:24	(Cuz Johnny hadn't yet been yeeted into prison.) 

Jn 3:25	So a dispute occurred on da part of Johnny's homeboys w a Jew abt purification.
Jn 3:26	And they came 2 Johnny n said 2 him, "Rabbi, he who wuz w u on da other side of da Jordan, 'bout whom u testified--look, dis 1 is baptizin’, n all r comin’ 2 him!" 

Jn 3:27	Johnny answered n said, "A man can get not 1 thang unless it’s granted 2 him from heaven!
Jn 3:28	U yoselves testify 'bout me dat i said, 'i ain’t da Christ, but im sent b4 dat 1.'
Jn 3:29	Da 1 who haz da bride is da bridegroom. But da friend of da bridegroom, who stands n hears him, rejoices greatly cuz of da bridegroom's voice. So dis happiness of mine is complete.
Jn 3:30	It’s necessary 4 dat 1 2 increase, but 4 me 2 decrease." 

Jn 3:31	Da 1 who comes from above is over all. Da 1 who is from da earth is from da earth n speaks from da earth; da 1 who comes from heaven is over all.
Jn 3:32	Wut he’s seen n heard, dis he testifies, n nobody accepts his testimony.
Jn 3:33	Da 1 who accepts his testimony haz attested dat God is tru.
Jn 3:34	Cuz da 1 whom God sent speaks da words of God, 4 he doesn't give da Spirit by measure.
Jn 3:35	Da Dad luvs da Son n haz given all tingz into his hand.
Jn 3:36	Da 1 who believes in da Son haz lyf 4ever, but da 1 who disobeys da Son won’t c lyf--but da wrath of God remains on him. 


CHAPTER 4
Jn 4:1	Now when Jesus knew dat da Pharisees had heard dat Jesus wuz making n baptizin’ more homeboys than Johnny
Jn 4:2	(even tho Jesus himself wasn’t baptizin’, but his homeboys),
Jn 4:3	he left Judea n departed again 4 Galilee.
Jn 4:4	And 'twas necessary 4 him 2 go thru Samaria. 

Jn 4:5	Now he came 2 a town of Samaria called Sychar, near da piece of land dat Jake had given 2 his son Joey.
Jn 4:6	And Jake's well wuz there, so Jesus, cuz he had become tired from da journey, simply sat down at da well. It wuz 'bout da 6th hr. 

Jn 4:7	A woman of Samaria came 2 draw water. Jesus said 2 her, "Give me water 2 drink."
Jn 4:8	(Cuz his homies had gone away into da town so dat they could buy food.)
Jn 4:9	So da Samaritan woman said 2 him, "How do u, bein’ a Jew, ask from me water 2 drink, since im a Samaritan woman?" (Cuz Jews hav no dealings w Samaritans.) 

Jn 4:10	Jesus answered n said 2 her, "If u had known da gift of God n who it’s who says 2 u, 'Give me water 2 drink,' u would’ve asked him, n he’d hav given u livin’ water."
Jn 4:11	Da woman said 2 him, "Sir, u hav no bucket n da well is deep! From where then do u get dis livin’ water?
Jn 4:12	U aren’t better than our dad Jake, r u, who gave us da well n drank from it himself, n his sons n his livestock?" 

Jn 4:13	Jesus answered n said 2 her, "E’erybody who drinks of dis water gonna be thirsty again.
Jn 4:14	But whoever drinks of dis water which i’ll give 2 him will never be thirsty 4 eternity, but da water which i’ll give 2 him will become in him a well of water springing up 2 lyf 4ever."
Jn 4:15	Da woman said 2 him, "Sir, gimme dis water, so dat i’ll not be thirsty or come here 2 draw water!"
Jn 4:16	He said 2 her, "Go, call yo husband n come here."
Jn 4:17	Da woman answered n said 2 him, "i don’t hav a husband." Jesus said 2 her, "U hav said rightly, 'i don’t hav a husband,'
Jn 4:18	4 u hav had 5 husbands, n da 1 whom u hav now isn’t yo husband; dis u hav said truthfully!" 

Jn 4:19	Da woman said 2 him, "Sir, i c dat u r a prophet.
Jn 4:20	Our dads worshiped on dis mountain, n u ppl say dat in Jerusalem is da place where it’s necessary 2 worship."
Jn 4:21	Jesus said 2 her, "Believe me, woman, dat an hr is comin’ when neither on dis mountain nor in Jerusalem will u worship da Dad.
Jn 4:22	U worship wut u dunno. We worship wut we kno, cuz salvation is from da Jews.
Jn 4:23	But an hr is comin’--n now is here--when da tru worshipers will worship da Dad in spirit n truth, 4 indeed da Dad seeks such ppl 2 be his worshipers.
Jn 4:24	God is spirit, n da ones who worship him must worship in spirit n truth."
Jn 4:25	Da woman said 2 him, "i kno dat Messiah is comin’" (da 1 called Christ); "whenever dat 1 comes, he’ll proclaim all tingz 2 us."
Jn 4:26	Jesus said 2 her, "i, da 1 talkin’ 2 u, am he. 

Jn 4:27	And at dis point his homeboys came, n they were shook dat he wuz talkin’ w a woman. However, nobody said, "Wut do u seek?" or "Y r u talkin’ w her?"
Jn 4:28	So da woman left her water jar n went away into da town n said 2 da ppl,
Jn 4:29	"Come, c a man who told me everythin’ i’ve ever done! Maybe dis 1 is da Christ?"
Jn 4:30	They went out from da town n were comin’ 2 him. 

Jn 4:31	In da meanwhile da homies were asking him, sayin’, "Rabbi, eat somethin’!"
Jn 4:32	But he said 2 them, "i’ve food 2 eat dat u dunno 'bout."
Jn 4:33	So da homeboys began 2 tell 1 anotha, "No 1 brought him anythin’ 2 eat, did they?"
Jn 4:34	Jesus said 2 them, "My food is dat i do da will of da 1 who sent me n complete his work.
Jn 4:35	Do u not say, 'There r yet 4 months n da harvest comes'? Look, i tell u, lift up yo eyes n look at da fields, dat they’re white 4 harvest already.
Jn 4:36	Da 1 who reaps receives wages n gathers fruit 4 lyf 4ever, so dat da 1 who sows n da 1 who reaps can rejoice together.
Jn 4:37	Cuz in dis instance da sayin’ is tru, 'It’s 1 who sows n anotha who reaps.'
Jn 4:38	i sent u 2 reap wut u didn't work 4; others hav worked, n u hav entered into their work." 

Jn 4:39	Now from dat town many of da Samaritans believed in him cuz of da word of da woman who testified, "He told me everythin’ dat i’ve done."
Jn 4:40	So when da Samaritans came 2 him, they began asking him 2 stay w them. And he stayed there 2 days.
Jn 4:41	And many more believed cuz of his word,
Jn 4:42	And they were sayin’ 2 da woman, "No longer cuz of wut u said do we believe, 4 we ourselves hav heard, n we kno dat dis 1 is fr da Savior of da world!" 

Jn 4:43	And after da 2 days he departed from there into Galilee.
Jn 4:44	Cuz Jesus himself testified dat a prophet haz no honor in his own homeland.
Jn 4:45	So when he came 2 Galilee, da Galileans welcomed him, cuz they had seen all da tingz he had done in Jerusalem at da feast (4 they themselves had also come 2 da feast). 

Jn 4:46	Now he came again 2 Cana in Galilee, where he had made da water wine. And there wuz at Capernaum a certain royal official whose son wuz sick.
Jn 4:47	Dis man, when he heard dat Jesus had come from Judea into Galilee, went 2 him n asked dat he come down n heal his son, 4 he wuz 'bout 2 die.
Jn 4:48	So Jesus said 2 him, "Unless u ppl c signs n wonders, u will never believe!"
Jn 4:49	Da royal official said 2 him, "Sir, come down b4 my kid dies!"
Jn 4:50	Jesus said 2 him, "Go, yo son will live." Da man believed da word dat Jesus spoke 2 him, n he departed. 

Jn 4:51	Now as he wuz goin’ down, his slaves met him, sayin’ dat his kid wuz alive.
Jn 4:52	So he inquired from them da hr at which he had gotten better. Then they said 2 him, "Yesterday at da 7th hr da fever left him."
Jn 4:53	So da dad knew dat 'twas dat same hr at which Jesus said 2 him, "Yo son will live," n he himself believed, n his whole household.
Jn 4:54	Now dis is again a 2nd sign Jesus performed when he came from Judea into Galilee. 


CHAPTER 5
Jn 5:1	After deez tingz there wuz a feast of da Jews, n Jesus went up 2 Jerusalem.
Jn 5:2	Now there’s in Jerusalem near da Sheep Gate a pool called in Aramaic Bethzatha, which haz 5 porticoes.
Jn 5:3	In deez were lying a large numba of those who were sick, blind, lame, paralyzed.
Jn 5:5	And a certain man wuz there who had been 38 yrs in his sickness.
Jn 5:6	Jesus, when he saw dis 1 lying there n knew dat he had been sick a long time already, said 2 him, "Do u wanna become well?"
Jn 5:7	Da 1 who wuz sick answered him, "Sir, i don’t hav anyone dat, whenever da water is stirred up, could put me into da pool. But while im comin’, anotha goes down b4 me."
Jn 5:8	Jesus said 2 him, "Get up! Pick up yo mat n walk!"
Jn 5:9	And immediately da man became well n picked up his mat n began 2 walk. (Now 'twas da Sabbath on dat day.) 

Jn 5:10	So da Jews were sayin’ 2 da 1 who had been healed, "It’s da Sabbath, n it isn’t ok 4 u 2 pick up da mat!"
Jn 5:11	But he answered them, "Da 1 who made me well--dat 1 said 2 me, 'Pick up yo mat n walk!'"
Jn 5:12	So they asked him, "Who is da man who said 2 u, 'Pick up yo mat n walk?'"
Jn 5:13	But da 1 who wuz healed didn't kno who 'twas, 4 Jesus had withdrawn while a crowd wuz in da place. 

Jn 5:14	After deez tingz Jesus found him at da temple n said 2 him, "Look, u hav become well! Sin no longer, lest somethin’ worse happen 2 u."
Jn 5:15	Da man went n reported 2 da Jews dat Jesus wuz da 1 who made him well.
Jn 5:16	And on account of dis da Jews began 2 persecute Jesus, cuz he wuz doin’ deez tingz on da Sabbath.
Jn 5:17	But he answered them, "My Dad is working until now, n im working."
Jn 5:18	So on account of dis da Jews were seeking even more 2 kill him, cuz he not only wuz breaking da Sabbath, but also wuz calling God his own Dad, so making himself equal w God. 

Jn 5:19	So Jesus answered n said 2 them, "Fr, tbh, da Son can do nothin’ from himself except wut he sees da Dad doin’. Cuz whatever dat 1 does, deez tingz also da Son does like dat.
Jn 5:20	Cuz da Dad luvs da Son n shows him everythin’ dat he himself is doin’. And better works than deez he’ll show him, so dat u gonna be shook.
Jn 5:21	Cuz just like da Dad raises da ded n makes them alive, so also da Son makes alive whomever he wishes.
Jn 5:22	Cuz da Dad doesn't judge anyone, but he’s given all judgment 2 da Son,
Jn 5:23	so dat all ppl will honor da Son, just like they honor da Dad. Da 1 who doesn't honor da Son doesn't honor da Dad who sent him.
Jn 5:24	Fr, tbh da 1 who hears my word n who believes da 1 who sent me haz lyf 4ever, n doesn't come into judgment, but haz passed from death into lyf. 

Jn 5:25	"Fr, tbh, dat an hr is comin’--n now is here--when da ded will hear da voice of da Son of God, n da ones who hear will live.
Jn 5:26	Cuz just like da Dad haz lyf in himself, so also he’s granted 2 da Son 2 hav lyf in himself.
Jn 5:27	And he’s granted him authority 2 carry out judgment, cuz he’s da Son of Man. 

Jn 5:28	"Don’t be shook at dis, cuz an hr is comin’ in which all those in da tombs will hear his voice
Jn 5:29	n they’ll come out--those who hav done gud tingz 2 a resurrection of lyf, but those who hav practiced bad tingz 2 a resurrection of judgment.
Jn 5:30	im able 2 do nothin’ from myself. Just as i hear, i judge, n my judgment is just, cuz i don’t seek my own will, but da will of da 1 who sent me. 

Jn 5:31	"If i testify 'bout myself, my testimony isn’t tru.
Jn 5:32	There is anotha who testifies 'bout me, n i kno dat da testimony which he testifies 'bout me is tru.
Jn 5:33	U hav sent 2 Johnny n he’s testified 2 da truth.
Jn 5:34	(And i don’t get testimony from ppl, but i say deez tingz so dat u may be saved.)
Jn 5:35	Dat 1 wuz da lamp which wuz burning n shining, n u wanted 2 rejoice 4 an hr in his light. 

Jn 5:36	"But i’ve a testimony better than Johnny's, 4 da works which da Dad haz given 2 me dat i shud complete them--da very works which im doin’--deez testify 'bout me, dat da Dad haz sent me.
Jn 5:37	And da Dad who sent me, dat 1 haz testified 'bout me. U hav neither heard his voice at any time nor seen his form.
Jn 5:38	And u don’t hav his word livin’ in yoselves, cuz da 1 whom dat 1 sent, in dis 1 u don’t believe.
Jn 5:39	U search da scriptures cuz u think dat u hav lyf 4ever in them, n it’s deez dat testify 'bout me.
Jn 5:40	And u aren’t willing 2 come 2 me so dat u may hav lyf. 

Jn 5:41	"i don’t accept glory from ppl,
Jn 5:42	but i kno u, dat u don’t hav da luv of God in yoselves.
Jn 5:43	i’ve come in my Dad's name, n u don’t accept me. If anotha shud come in his own name, u would accept dat 1!
Jn 5:44	How r u able 2 believe, if u accept glory from 1 anotha, n don’t seek da glory which is from da only God?
Jn 5:45	Don’t think dat i’ll accuse u b4 da Dad! Da 1 who accuses u is Moe, in whom u hav put yo hope!
Jn 5:46	Cuz if u had believed Moe, u would believe me, 4 dat 1 wrote 'bout me.
Jn 5:47	But if u don’t believe dat 1's writings, how’ll u believe my words?" 


CHAPTER 6
Jn 6:1	After deez tingz Jesus went away 2 da other side of da sea of Galilee (dat’s, Tiberias).
Jn 6:2	And a large crowd wuz following him cuz they were observing da signs dat he wuz doin’ on those who were sick.
Jn 6:3	So Jesus went up on da mountain n sat down there w his homeboys.
Jn 6:4	(Now da Passover, da feast of da Jews, wuz near.)
Jn 6:5	Then Jesus, when he looked up  n saw dat a large crowd wuz comin’ 2 him, said 2 Phil, "Where can we buy bread so dat deez ppl can eat?"
Jn 6:6	(Now he said dis 2 test him, cuz he knew wut he wuz goin’ 2 do.)
Jn 6:7	Phil replied 2 him, "2 hundred denarii worth of bread would not be enough 4 them, so dat each 1 could get a lil’."
Jn 6:8	1 of his homies, Andrew da bro of Simon Pete, said 2 him,
Jn 6:9	"Here is a boi who haz 5 barley loaves n 2 fish, but wut r deez 4 so many ppl?"
Jn 6:10	Jesus said, "Make da ppl recline." (Now there wuz a lotta grass in da place.) So da men reclined, approximately 5 K in numba.
Jn 6:11	Then Jesus took da bread, n after he had given thanks, he distributed it 2 those who were reclining--like dat also of da fish, as much as they wanted.
Jn 6:12	And when they were satisfied, he said 2 his homies, "Gather da remaining pieces so dat nothin’ is lost."
Jn 6:13	So they gathered them, n filled 12 baskets w pieces from da 5 barley loaves which were left over by those who had eaten. 

Jn 6:14	Now when da ppl saw da sign dat he performed, they began 2 say, "Dis 1 is fr da Prophet who is 2 come into da world!"
Jn 6:15	Then Jesus, cuz he knew dat they were 'bout 2 come n seize him in order 2 make him king, withdrew again up da mountain by himself alone. 

Jn 6:16	Now when evening came, his homies went down 2 da sea.
Jn 6:17	And getting into a boat, they began 2 go 2 da other side of da sea, 2 Capernaum. And it had already become dark, n Jesus hadn't yet come 2 them.
Jn 6:18	And da sea began 2 be stirred up cuz a strong wind wuz blowing.
Jn 6:19	Then when they had rowed 'bout 25 or thirty stadia, they saw Jesus walking on da sea n comin’ near da boat, n they were afraid.
Jn 6:20	But he said 2 them, "It’s i! Don’t be afraid!"
Jn 6:21	So they were wanting 2 take him into da boat, n immediately da boat came 2 da land 2 which they were goin’. 

Jn 6:22	On da next day, da crowd dat wuz on da other side of da sea saw dat other boats weren't there (except 1), n dat Jesus hadn't entered w his homeboys into da boat, but his homies had departed alone.
Jn 6:23	Other boats from Tiberias came near da place where they had eaten da bread after da Lord had given thanks.
Jn 6:24	So when da crowd saw dat Jesus wasn’t there, nor his homies, they themselves got into da boats n came 2 Capernaum seeking Jesus. 

Jn 6:25	And when they found him on da other side of da sea, they said 2 him, "Rabbi, when did u get here?"
Jn 6:26	Jesus replied 2 them n said, "Fr, tbh, u seek me not cuz u saw signs, but cuz u ate of da loaves n were satisfied!
Jn 6:27	Don’t work 4 da food dat dies, but da food dat remains 2 lyf 4ever, which da Son of Man will give 2 u. Cuz God da Dad haz set his seal on dis 1." 

Jn 6:28	So they said 2 him, "Wut will we do dat we can accomplish da works of God?"
Jn 6:29	Jesus answered n said 2 them, "Dis is da work of God: dat u believe in da 1 whom dat 1 sent."
Jn 6:30	So they said 2 him, "Then wut sign will u perform, so dat we can c it n believe u? Wut will u do?
Jn 6:31	Our dads ate da manna in da wilderness, just like it’s written, 'He gave them bread from heaven 2 eat.' 

Jn 6:32	Then Jesus said 2 them, "Fr, tbh, Moe didn't give u bread from heaven, but my Dad is giving u da tru bread from heaven!
Jn 6:33	Cuz da bread of God is da 1 who comes down from heaven n gives lyf 2 da world."
Jn 6:34	So they said 2 him, "Sir, always give us dis bread!" 

Jn 6:35	Jesus said 2 them, "im da bread of lyf. Da 1 who comes 2 me will never be hungry, n da 1 who believes in me will never be thirsty again.
Jn 6:36	But i said 2 u dat u hav seen me n don’t believe.
Jn 6:37	E’erybody whom da Dad gives 2 me will come 2 me, n da 1 who comes 2 me i’ll never yeet out,
Jn 6:38	cuz i’ve come down from heaven not dat i shud do wut i want, but da will of da 1 who sent me.
Jn 6:39	Now dis is da will of da 1 who sent me: dat e’erybody whom he’s given me, i’d not lose any of them, but raise them up on da last day.
Jn 6:40	Cuz of dis is da will of my Dad, dat e’erybody who looks at da Son n believes in him would’ve lyf 4ever, n i’ll raise him up on da last day." 

Jn 6:41	Now da Jews began 2 grumble 'bout him cuz he said, "im da bread dat came down from heaven,"
Jn 6:42	n they were sayin’, "Is dis 1 not Jesus da son of Joey, whose dad n mom we kno? How does he now say, 'i’ve come down from heaven'?"
Jn 6:43	Jesus answered n said 2 them, "Don’t grumble among yoselves!
Jn 6:44	No 1 is able 2 come 2 me unless da Dad who sent me draws him, n i’ll raise him up on da last day.
Jn 6:45	It’s written in da prophets, 'And they’ll all be taught by God.' E’erybody who hears from da Dad n learns comes 2 me.
Jn 6:46	(Not dat anyone haz seen da Dad except da 1 who is from God--dis 1 haz seen da Dad.)
Jn 6:47	Fr, tbh, da 1 who believes haz lyf 4ever.
Jn 6:48	im da bread of lyf.
Jn 6:49	Yo dads ate da manna in da wilderness n they died.
Jn 6:50	Dis is da bread dat comes down from heaven so dat someone may eat from it n not die.
Jn 6:51	im da livin’ bread dat came down from heaven. If anyone eats from dis bread, he’ll live 4ever. And da bread dat i’ll give 4 da lyf of da world is my flesh." 

Jn 6:52	So da Jews began 2 quarrel among themselves, sayin’, "How can dis man give us his flesh 2 eat?"
Jn 6:53	Then Jesus said 2 them, "Fr, tbh, unless u eat da flesh of da Son of Man n drink his blood, u don’t hav lyf in yoselves!
Jn 6:54	Da 1 who eats my flesh n drinks my blood haz lyf 4ever, n i’ll raise him up on da last day.
Jn 6:55	Cuz my flesh is tru food, n my blood is tru drink.
Jn 6:56	Da 1 who eats my flesh n drinks my blood lives in me n i in him.
Jn 6:57	Just as da livin’ Dad sent me, n i live cuz of da Dad, so also da 1 who eats me--dat 1 will live cuz of me.
Jn 6:58	Dis is da bread dat came down from heaven, not as da dads ate n died. Da 1 who eats dis bread will live 4ever." 

Jn 6:59	He said deez tingz while teaching in da synagogue in Capernaum.
Jn 6:60	So many of his homies, when they heard it, said, "Dis sayin’ is hard! Who can understand it?"
Jn 6:61	But Jesus, cuz he knew within himself dat his homies were grumbling 'bout dis, said 2 them, "Does dis cause u 2 be offended?
Jn 6:62	Then wut if u c da Son of Man goin’ up where he wuz b4?
Jn 6:63	Da Spirit is da 1 who gives lyf; da flesh profits nothin’. Da words dat i’ve spoken 2 u r spirit n r lyf.
Jn 6:64	But there r some of u who don’t believe." (Cuz Jesus knew from da beginning who they were who didn't believe, n who 'twas who’d betray him.)
Jn 6:65	And he said, "Cuz of dis i said 2 u dat nobody can come 2 me unless it’s been granted 2 him by da Dad." 

Jn 6:66	Cuz of dis reason many of his homeboys drew back n weren't walking w him any longer.
Jn 6:67	So Jesus said 2 da 12, "U don’t wanna go away also, do u?"
Jn 6:68	Simon Pete answered him, "Lord, 2 whom would we go? U hav da words of lyf 4ever.
Jn 6:69	And we've believed, n hav come 2 kno, dat u r da Holy 1 of God."
Jn 6:70	Jesus replied 2 them, "Did i not choose u, da 12, n 1 of u is da devil?"
Jn 6:71	(Now he wuz talkin’ 'bout Judas son of Simon Iscariot, cuz dis 1--1 of da 12--wuz goin’ 2 betray him.) 


CHAPTER 7
Jn 7:1	And after deez tingz Jesus wuz goin’ 'bout in Galilee. Cuz he didn't wanna go 'bout in Judea, cuz da Jews were seeking 2 kill him.
Jn 7:2	Now da feast of da Jews--da feast of Tabernacles--wuz near.
Jn 7:3	So his bros said 2 him, "Depart from here n go 2 Judea, so dat yo homies also can c yo works dat u r doin’.
Jn 7:4	Cuz nobody does anythin’ in secret n yet he himself desires 2 be publicly recognized. If u r doin’ deez tingz, reveal yoself 2 da world!"
Jn 7:5	(Cuz not even his bros believed in him.) 

Jn 7:6	So Jesus said 2 them, "My time hasn't yet come, but yo time is always ready.
Jn 7:7	Da world can’t h8 u, but it hates me, cuz im testifying 'bout it, dat its deeds r bad.
Jn 7:8	U go up 2 da feast. i ain’t goin’ up 2 dis feast, cuz my time isn’t yet completed.
Jn 7:9	And when he had said deez tingz, he remained in Galilee. 

Jn 7:10	But when his bros had gone up 2 da feast, then he also went up, not openly, but (as it were) in secret.
Jn 7:11	So da Jews were looking 4 him at da feast, n were sayin’, "Where is he?"
Jn 7:12	And there wuz a lotta grumbling abt him among da crowds; some were sayin’, "He is a gud man," but others were sayin’, "No, but he deceives da crowd."
Jn 7:13	However, nobody wuz talkin’ openly 'bout him 4 fear of da Jews. 

Jn 7:14	Now when da feast wuz already half over, Jesus went 2 da temple courts n began 2 teach.
Jn 7:15	Then da Jews were shook, sayin’, "How does dis man possess knowledge, cuz he hasn't been taught?"
Jn 7:16	So Jesus answered them n said, "My teaching isn’t mine, but is from da 1 who sent me.
Jn 7:17	If anyone wants 2 do wut he wants, he’ll kno 'bout my teaching, whether it’s from God or im talkin’ from myself.
Jn 7:18	Da 1 who speaks from himself seeks his own glory. But da 1 who seeks da glory of da 1 who sent him--dis 1 is tru, n there’s no unrighteousness in him.
Jn 7:19	Has not Moe given u da law, n none of u carries out da law? Y do u seek 2 kill me?" 

Jn 7:20	Da crowd replied, "U hav a demon! Who is seeking 2 kill u?"
Jn 7:21	Jesus answered n said 2 them, "i performed 1 work, n u r all shook.
Jn 7:22	Cuz of dis Moe haz given u circumcision (not dat it’s from Moe, but from da dads), n u cut a man on da Sabbath.
Jn 7:23	If a man receives circumcision on da Sabbath so dat da law of Moe would not be broken, r u angry w me cuz i made a whole man well on da Sabbath?
Jn 7:24	Don’t judge accordin’ 2 outward appearance, but judge accordin’ 2 gud judgment!" 

Jn 7:25	Then some of da ppl of Jerusalem began 2 say, "Is dis not da 1 whom they’re seeking 2 kill?
Jn 7:26	And look, he’s talkin’ openly n they’re sayin’ nothin’ 2 him! Can it be dat da rulers fr kno dat dis man is da Christ?
Jn 7:27	Yet we kno where dis man is from, but da Christ, whenever he comes--nobody knows where he’s from!" 

Jn 7:28	Then Jesus cried out in da temple courts, teaching n sayin’, "U both kno me n u kno where im from! And i haven't come from myself, but da 1 who sent me is tru, whom u dunno.
Jn 7:29	i kno him, cuz im from him n he sent me." 

Jn 7:30	So they were seeking 2 seize him, n nobody laid a hand on him, cuz his hr hadn't yet come.
Jn 7:31	But from da crowd many believed in him n were sayin’, "Whenever da Christ comes, he’ll not perform more signs than dis man haz done, will he?" 

Jn 7:32	Da Pharisees heard da crowd murmuring deez tingz 'bout him, n da chief priests n da Pharisees sent officers in order 2 take him into custody .
Jn 7:33	Then Jesus said, "Yet a lil’ time im w u, n im goin’ 2 da 1 who sent me.
Jn 7:34	U will seek me n won’t find me, n where im, u can’t come." 

Jn 7:35	So da Jews said 2 1 anotha, "Where is dis 1 goin’ 2 go, dat we'll not find him? He isn’t goin’ 2 go 2 da Dispersion among da Greeks n teach da Greeks, is he?
Jn 7:36	Wut is dis sayin’ dat he said, 'U will seek me n won’t find me, n where im, u can’t come'?" 

Jn 7:37	Now on da last day of da feast--da great day--Jesus stood n cried out, sayin’, "If anyone is thirsty, let him come 2 me, n let him drink,
Jn 7:38	da 1 who believes in me. Just as da scripture said, 'Out of his belly will flow rivers of livin’ water.'"
Jn 7:39	Now he said dis abt da Spirit, whom those who believed in him were 'bout 2 get. Cuz da Spirit wasn’t yet given, cuz Jesus hadn't yet been glorified.) 

Jn 7:40	Then, when they heard deez words, some from da crowd began 2 say, "Dis man is fr da Prophet!"
Jn 7:41	Others were sayin’, "Dis man is da Christ!" But others were sayin’, "No, 4 da Christ doesn't come from Galilee, does he?
Jn 7:42	Has not da scripture said dat da Christ comes from da descendants of Dave, n from Bethlehem, da village where Dave wuz?"
Jn 7:43	So there wuz a division in da crowd cuz of him.
Jn 7:44	And some of them were wanting 2 seize him, but nobody laid hands on him. 

Jn 7:45	So da officers came 2 da chief priests n Pharisees. And they said 2 them, "Y did u not bring him?"
Jn 7:46	Da officers replied, "Never haz a man spoken like dis!"
Jn 7:47	Then da Pharisees replied 2 them, "U haven't also been deceived, hav u?
Jn 7:48	None of da rulers or of da Pharisees hav believed in him, hav they?
Jn 7:49	But dis crowd who doesn't kno da law is accursed!" 

Jn 7:50	Nicodemus, da 1 who came 2 him previously--who wuz 1 of them--said 2 them,
Jn 7:51	"Our law doesn't condemn a man unless it 1st hears from him n knows wut he’s doin’, does it?"
Jn 7:52	They answered n said 2 him, "U aren’t also from Galilee, r u? Investigate n c dat a prophet doesn't arise from Galilee!" [[
Jn 7:53	And each 1 went 2 his own house. 


CHAPTER 8
Jn 8:1	But Jesus went 2 da Mount of Olives.
Jn 8:2	Now early in da mornin’ he came again 2 da temple courts. And all da ppl were comin’, n he sat down n began 2 teach them. 

Jn 8:3	Now da scribes n da Pharisees brought 2 him a woman caught in cheating. And standing her in their midst,
Jn 8:4	they said 2 him, testing him, "Teacher, dis woman wuz caught in da very act of committing cheating!
Jn 8:5	Now in da law, Moe commanded us 2 stone such women. So wut do u say?"
Jn 8:6	(Now they were sayin’ dis 2 test him, so dat they’d hav an occasion 2 bring charges against him.) But Jesus, bending down, began 2 write w his finger on da ground, taking no notice.
Jn 8:7	And when they persisted in asking him, straightening up he said 2 them, "Da 1 of u without sin, let him yeet da 1st stone at her!"
Jn 8:8	And bending down again, he wrote on da ground.
Jn 8:9	Now when they heard it, bein’ convicted by their conscience, they began 2 depart, 1 by 1, beginning w da older ones, n Jesus wuz left alone--n da woman who wuz in their midst.
Jn 8:10	So Jesus, straightening up n seeing nobody except da woman, said 2 her, "Where r those accusers of urs? Does nobody condemn u?"
Jn 8:11	And she said, "No 1, Lord." So Jesus said, "Neither do i condemn u. Go, n sin no more."]] 

Jn 8:12	Then Jesus spoke 2 them again, sayin’, "im da light of da world! Da 1 who follows me will never walk in darkness, but will hav da light of lyf."
Jn 8:13	So da Pharisees said 2 him, "U testify abt yoself! Yo testimony isn’t tru."
Jn 8:14	Jesus answered n said 2 them, "Even if i testify abt myself, my testimony is tru, cuz i kno where i’ve come from n where im goin’. But u dunno where i’ve come from or where im goin’.
Jn 8:15	U judge accordin’ 2 externals; i don’t judge anyone.
Jn 8:16	But even if i judge, my judgment is tru, cuz i ain’t alone, but i n da Dad who sent me.
Jn 8:17	And even in yo law it’s written dat da testimony of 2 men is tru.
Jn 8:18	im da 1 who testifies abt myself, n da Dad who sent me testifies abt me." 

Jn 8:19	So they were sayin’ 2 him, "Where is yo dad?" Jesus replied, "U kno neither me nor my Dad! If u had known me, u would’ve known my Dad also."
Jn 8:20	He spoke deez words by da treasury while teaching in da temple courts, n nobody seized him, cuz his hr hadn't yet come. 

Jn 8:21	So he said 2 them again, "im goin’ away, n u will seek me n will die in yo sin. Where im goin’ u can’t come!"
Jn 8:22	Then da Jews began 2 say, "Maybe he’ll kill himself, cuz he’s sayin’, 'Where im goin’ u can’t come.'"
Jn 8:23	And he said 2 them, "U r from below; im from above. U r from dis world; i ain’t from dis world.
Jn 8:24	So i said 2 u dat u will die in yo sins. Cuz if u don’t believe dat im he, u will die in yo sins." 

Jn 8:25	So they began 2 tell him, "Who r u?" Jesus said 2 them, "Wut i’ve been sayin’ 2 u from da beginning.
Jn 8:26	i’ve many tingz 2 say n 2 judge abt u, but da 1 who sent me is tru, n da tingz which i heard from him, deez tingz i tell da world."
Jn 8:27	(They didn't kno dat he wuz talkin’ 2 them 'bout da Dad.) 

Jn 8:28	Then Jesus said, "When u lift up da Son of Man, then u will recognize dat im he, n i do nothin’ from myself, but just like da Dad taught me, i say deez tingz.
Jn 8:29	And da 1 who sent me is w me. He hasn't left me alone, cuz i always do da tingz dat r pleasing 2 him."
Jn 8:30	While he wuz sayin’ deez tingz, many believed in him. 

Jn 8:31	Then Jesus said 2 those Jews who had believed him, "If u continue in my word u r fr my homeboys,
Jn 8:32	n u will kno da truth, n da truth will set u free."
Jn 8:33	They replied 2 him, "We r descendants of Abe n haven't been enslaved 2 anyone at any time. How do u say, 'U will become free'?"
Jn 8:34	Jesus replied 2 them, "Fr, tbh, dat e’erybody who commits sin is a slave of sin.
Jn 8:35	And da slave doesn't remain in da household 4ever; da son remains 4ever.
Jn 8:36	So if da son sets u free, u gonna be fr free.
Jn 8:37	i kno dat u r descendants of Abe. But u r seeking 2 kill me, cuz my word makes no progress among u.
Jn 8:38	i talk da tingz dat i’ve seen w da Dad; so also u do da tingz dat u hav heard from da Dad." 

Jn 8:39	They answered n said 2 him, "Abe is our dad!" Jesus said 2 them, "If u r kids of Abe, do da deeds of Abe!
Jn 8:40	But now u r seeking 2 kill me, a man who spoke 2 u da truth which i heard from God. Dis Abe didn't do.
Jn 8:41	U r doin’ da deeds of yo dad!" 
 They said 2 him, "We weren't born from sexual immorality! We hav 1 dad, God!"
Jn 8:42	Jesus said 2 them, "If God were yo dad, u would luv me, cuz i’ve come forth from God n hav come. Cuz i haven't come from myself, but dat 1 sent me.
Jn 8:43	Y do u not understand my wae of talkin’? Cuz u aren’t able 2 listen 2 my msg.
Jn 8:44	U r of yo dad da devil, n u wanna do da desires of yo dad! Dat 1 wuz a murderer from da beginning, n doesn't stand firm in da truth, cuz truth isn’t in him. Whenever he speaks da lie, he speaks from his own nature, cuz he’s a liar n da dad of lies.
Jn 8:45	But cuz im telling da truth, u don’t believe me.
Jn 8:46	Who among u convicts me abt sin? If im telling da truth, y do u not believe me?
Jn 8:47	Da 1 who is from God listens 2 da words of God. Cuz of dis u don’t listen--cuz u aren’t of God." 

Jn 8:48	Da Jews answered n said 2 him, "Do we not correctly say dat u r a Samaritan n hav a demon?"
Jn 8:49	Jesus replied, "i don’t hav a demon, but i honor my Dad, n u dishonor me!
Jn 8:50	But i don’t seek my own glory. There is 1 who seeks n judges!
Jn 8:51	Fr, tbh, if anyone keeps my word, he’ll never experience death 4ever." 

Jn 8:52	Da Jews said 2 him, "Now we kno dat u hav a demon! Abe n da prophets died, n u say, 'If anyone keeps my word, he’ll never taste death 4ever.'
Jn 8:53	U aren’t better than our dad Abe who died, r u? And da prophets died! Who do u make yoself 2 be?"
Jn 8:54	Jesus replied, "If i glorify myself, my glory is nothin’. Da 1 who glorifies me is my Dad, 'bout whom u say, 'He is our God.'
Jn 8:55	And u haven't known him, but i kno him. And if i were 2 say dat idk him, i’d be a liar like u! But i kno him n i keep his word.
Jn 8:56	Abe yo dad rejoiced dat he’d c my day, n he saw it n wuz glad." 

Jn 8:57	So da Jews said 2 him, "U aren’t yet fifty yrs old, n hav u seen Abe?"
Jn 8:58	Jesus said 2 them, "Fr, tbh, b4 Abe wuz, im!"
Jn 8:59	Then they picked up stones in order 2 yeet them at him. But Jesus wuz hidden n went out of da temple courts. 


CHAPTER 9
Jn 9:1	And as he went away, he saw a man blind from birth.
Jn 9:2	And his homeboys asked him, sayin’, "Rabbi, who sinned, dis man or his parents, dat he shud be born blind?"
Jn 9:3	Jesus replied, "Neither dis man sinned nor his parents, but it happened so dat da works of God could be revealed in him.
Jn 9:4	It’s necessary 4 us 2 do da deeds of da 1 who sent me while it’s day; night is comin’, when nobody can work!
Jn 9:5	While im in da world, im da light of da world."
Jn 9:6	When he had said deez tingz, he spat on da ground n made clay w da saliva, n smeared da clay on his eyes.
Jn 9:7	And he said 2 him, "Go, wash in da pool of Siloam" (which is translated "sent"). So he went n washed n came back seeing. 

Jn 9:8	Then da bros n those who saw him previously (cuz he wuz a beggar) began 2 say, "Is dis man not da 1 who used 2 sit n beg?"
Jn 9:9	Others were sayin’, "It’s dis man"; others were sayin’, "No, but he’s like him." Dat 1 wuz sayin’, "im he!"
Jn 9:10	So they began 2 tell him, "How were yo eyes opened?"
Jn 9:11	He replied, "Da man who is called Jesus made clay n smeared it on my eyes n said 2 me, 'Go 2 Siloam n wash!' So i went, n i washed, n i received sight."
Jn 9:12	And they said 2 him, "Where is dat man?" He said, "idk." 

Jn 9:13	They brought him--da 1 formerly blind--2 da Pharisees.
Jn 9:14	(Now da day on which Jesus made da clay n opened his eyes wuz da Sabbath.)
Jn 9:15	So da Pharisees also were asking him again how he received sight. And he said 2 them, "He put clay on my eyes, n i washed, n i c."
Jn 9:16	So some of da Pharisees were sayin’, "Dis man isn’t from God, cuz he doesn't observe da Sabbath!" Others were sayin’, "How can a man who is a sinner perform such signs?" And there wuz a division among them.
Jn 9:17	So they said 2 da blind man again, "Wut do u say 'bout him, cuz he opened yo eyes?" And he said, "He is a prophet." 

Jn 9:18	So da Jews didn't believe abt him dat he had been blind n received sight, until they summoned da parents of da 1 who received sight.
Jn 9:19	And they asked them, sayin’, "Is dis man yo son, whom u say wuz born blind? Then how does he now c?"
Jn 9:20	So his parents answered n said, "We kno dat dis man is our son, n dat he wuz born blind.
Jn 9:21	But how he now sees we dunno, or who opened his eyes we dunno. Ask him! He is a mature adult; he’ll talk 4 himself!"
Jn 9:22	(His parents said deez tingz cuz they were afraid of da Jews, 4 da Jews had already decided dat if anyone shud confess him 2 be Christ, he’d be expelled from da synagogue.
Jn 9:23	Cuz of dis his parents said, "He is a mature adult; ask him.") 

Jn 9:24	So they summoned da man who had been blind 4 da 2nd time n said 2 him, "Give glory 2 God! We kno dat dis man is a sinner!"
Jn 9:25	Then dat man replied, "Whether he’s a sinner idk. 1 thang i kno--dat even tho i wuz blind, now i c!"
Jn 9:26	So they said 2 him, "Wut did he do 2 u? How did he open yo eyes?"
Jn 9:27	He replied 2 them, "i told u already n u didn't listen! Y do u wanna hear it again? U don’t wanna become his homies also, do u?"
Jn 9:28	They reviled him n said, "U r his homie! But we're homies of Moe!
Jn 9:29	We kno dat God haz spoken 2 Moe, but we dunno where dis man is from."
Jn 9:30	Da man answered n said 2 them, "Cuz da remarkable thang is dis, dat u dunno where he’s from, n he opened my eyes!
Jn 9:31	We kno dat God doesn't listen 2 sinners, but if someone’s devout n does wut he wants, he listens 2 dis 1.
Jn 9:32	From time immemorial it hasn't been heard dat someone opened da eyes of 1 born blind.
Jn 9:33	If dis man weren't from God, he’d not be able 2 do anythin’!"
Jn 9:34	They answered n said 2 him, "U were born totally in sin, n r u attempting 2 teach us?" And they yote him out. 

Jn 9:35	Jesus heard dat they had yeeted him out, n finding him, he said, "Do u believe in da Son of Man?"
Jn 9:36	He answered n said, "And who is he, sir, dat i may believe in him?"
Jn 9:37	Jesus said 2 him, "U hav both seen him, n he’s da 1 who is talkin’ w u." [[
Jn 9:38	And he said, "i believe, Lord!" n he worshiped him.
Jn 9:39	And Jesus said,]] "Cuz judgment i’ve come into dis world, so dat those who don’t c may c, n those who c may become blind!"
Jn 9:40	Some of da Pharisees who were w him heard deez tingz n said 2 him, "We aren’t also blind, r we?"
Jn 9:41	Jesus said 2 them, "If u were blind, u wouldn’t’ve sin. But now u say, 'We c,' yo sin remains. 


CHAPTER 10
Jn 10:1	"Fr, tbh, da 1 who doesn't enter thru da door into da fold of da sheep, but climbs up at some other place--dat 1 is a thief n a robber.
Jn 10:2	But da 1 who enters thru da door is da shepherd of da sheep.
Jn 10:3	Cuz of dis 1 da doorkeeper opens, n da sheep hear his voice, n he calls his own sheep by name n leads them out.
Jn 10:4	Whenever he sends out all his own, he goes b4 them, n da sheep follow him cuz they kno his voice.
Jn 10:5	And they’ll never follow a stranger, but will flee from him, cuz they dunno da voice of strangers."
Jn 10:6	Jesus told them dis parable, but they didn't understand wut 'twas dat he wuz sayin’ 2 them. 

Jn 10:7	Then Jesus said 2 them again, "Fr, fr, i tell u, im da door of da sheep.
Jn 10:8	All those who came b4 me r thieves n robbers, but da sheep don’t listen 2 them.
Jn 10:9	im da door. If anyone enters thru me, he gonna be saved, n will come in n will go out n will find pasture.
Jn 10:10	Da thief comes only so dat he can steal n kill n destroy; i’ve come so dat they may hav lyf, n hav it abundantly. 

Jn 10:11	"im da gud shepherd. Da gud shepherd lays down his lyf 4 da sheep.
Jn 10:12	Da hired hand, who isn’t da shepherd, whose own da sheep aren’t, sees da wolf approaching n abandons da sheep n runs away--n da wolf seizes them n scatters them--
Jn 10:13	cuz he’s a hired hand n he’s not concerned 'bout da sheep. 

Jn 10:14	"im da gud shepherd, n i kno my own, n my own kno me,
Jn 10:15	just like da Dad knows me n i kno da Dad, n i lay down my lyf 4 da sheep.
Jn 10:16	And i’ve other sheep which aren’t from dis fold. i must bring deez also, n they’ll hear my voice, n they’ll become 1 flock--1 shepherd.
Jn 10:17	Cuz of dis da Dad luvs me, cuz i lay down my lyf so dat i may take possession of it again.
Jn 10:18	No 1 takes it from me, but i lay it down voluntarily. i’ve authority 2 lay it down, n i’ve authority 2 take possession of it again. Dis rule i received from my Dad." 

Jn 10:19	Again there wuz a division among da Jews cuz of deez words.
Jn 10:20	And many of them were sayin’, "He haz a demon n is out of his mind! Y do u listen 2 him?"
Jn 10:21	Others were sayin’, "Deez aren’t da words of 1 who is possessed by a demon! A demon isn’t able 2 open da eyes of da blind, is it?" 

Jn 10:22	Then da feast of da Dedication took place in Jerusalem. It wuz winter,
Jn 10:23	n Jesus wuz walking in da temple in da Portico of Solomon.
Jn 10:24	So da Jews surrounded him n began 2 tell him, "How long will u keep us in suspense? If u r da Christ, tell us straight!"
Jn 10:25	Jesus answered them, "i told u n u don’t believe! Da deeds dat i do in da name of my Dad, deez testify 'bout me.
Jn 10:26	But u don’t believe, cuz u aren’t of my sheep!
Jn 10:27	My sheep listen 2 my voice, n i kno them, n they follow me.
Jn 10:28	And i give them lyf 4ever, n they’ll never die 4ever, n nobody will seize them out of my hand.
Jn 10:29	My Dad, who haz given them 2 me, is better than all, n nobody can seize them from da Dad's hand.
Jn 10:30	Da Dad n i r 1." 

Jn 10:31	Then da Jews picked up stones again so dat they could stone him.
Jn 10:32	Jesus answered them, "i’ve shown u many gud deeds from da Dad. Cuz which 1 of them r u goin’ 2 stone me?"
Jn 10:33	Da Jews answered him, "We aren’t goin’ 2 stone u abt a gud deed, but abt blasphemy, n cuz u, even tho u r a man, make yoself 2 be God!"
Jn 10:34	Jesus answered them, "Is it not written in yo law, 'i said, "U r gods" '?
Jn 10:35	If he called them 'gods' 2 whom da word of God came--n da scripture can’t be broken--
Jn 10:36	do u say 'bout he whom da Dad set apart n sent into da world, 'U r blaspheming,' cuz i said, 'im da Son of God'?
Jn 10:37	If i don’t do da deeds of my Dad, don’t believe me.
Jn 10:38	But if im doin’ them, even if u don’t believe me, believe da deeds, so dat u may kno n understand dat da Dad is in me n im in da Dad."
Jn 10:39	So they were seeking again 2 seize him, n he departed out of their hand. 

Jn 10:40	And he went away again on da other side of da Jordan, 2 da place where Johnny wuz baptizin’ at an earlier time, n he stayed there.
Jn 10:41	And many came 2 him n began 2 say, "Johnny performed no sign, but everythin’ Johnny said 'bout dis man wuz tru!"
Jn 10:42	And many believed in him there. 


CHAPTER 11
Jn 11:1	Now a certain man wuz sick, Lazarus from Bethany, da village of Mary n her sister Martha.
Jn 11:2	(Now 'twas Mary who anointed da Lord w perfumed oil n wiped his feet w her hair, whose bro Lazarus wuz sick.)
Jn 11:3	So da sisters sent word 2 him, sayin’, "Lord, look, da 1 whom u luv is sick."
Jn 11:4	And when he heard it, Jesus said, "Dis sickness isn’t 2 death, but 4 da glory of God, so dat da Son of God may be glorified thru it."
Jn 11:5	(Now Jesus luvd Martha n her sister n Lazarus.)
Jn 11:6	So when he heard dat he wuz sick, then he remained in da place where he wuz 2 days. 

Jn 11:7	Then after dis he said 2 da homies, "Let us go 2 Judea again."
Jn 11:8	Da homeboys said 2 him, "Rabbi, da Jews were seeking just now 2 stone u, n r u goin’ there again?"
Jn 11:9	Jesus replied, R there not 12 hrs in da day? If anyone walks around in da daylight, he doesn't stumble, cuz he sees da light of dis world.
Jn 11:10	But if anyone walks around in da night, he stumbles, cuz da light isn’t in him.
Jn 11:11	He said deez tingz, n after dis he said 2 them, "Our friend Lazarus haz fallen asleep, but im goin’ so dat i can awaken him."
Jn 11:12	So da homeboys said 2 him, "Lord, if he’s fallen asleep, he’ll get well."
Jn 11:13	(Now Jesus had been talkin’ 'bout his death, but they thought dat he wuz talkin’ 'bout real sleep.)
Jn 11:14	So Jesus then said 2 them straight, "Lazarus haz died,
Jn 11:15	n im glad 4 yo sake dat i wasn’t there, so dat u may believe. But let’s go 2 him."
Jn 11:16	Then Tommy (da 1 who is called Didymus) said 2 his fellow homies, "Let us go also, so dat we may die w him." 

Jn 11:17	So when he arrived, Jesus found he had already been 4 days in da tomb.
Jn 11:18	(Now Bethany wuz near Jerusalem, 'bout 15 stadia.
Jn 11:19	So many of da Jews came 2 Martha n Mary in order 2 console them abt their bro.)
Jn 11:20	Now Martha, when she heard dat Jesus wuz comin’, went 2 meet him, but Mary wuz sitting in da house.
Jn 11:21	So Martha said 2 Jesus, "Lord, if u had been here, my bro wouldn’t’ve died.
Jn 11:22	Even now i kno dat whatever u ask God, God will grant u."
Jn 11:23	Jesus said 2 her, "Yo bro will rise again."
Jn 11:24	Martha said 2 him, "i kno dat he’ll rise again in da resurrection at da last day."
Jn 11:25	Jesus said 2 her, "im da resurrection n da lyf. Da 1 who believes in me, even if he dies, will live,
Jn 11:26	n e’erybody who lives n believes in me will never die 4ever. Do u believe dis?"
Jn 11:27	She said 2 him, "Yeah, Lord, i’ve believed dat u r da Christ, da Son of God, who comes into da world." 

Jn 11:28	And when she had said dis, she went n called her sister Mary privately, sayin’, "Da Teacher is here n is calling 4 u."
Jn 11:29	So dat 1, when she heard it, got up quickly n went 2 him.
Jn 11:30	(Now Jesus hasn't yet come into da village, but wuz still in da place where Martha went 2 meet him.)
Jn 11:31	So da Jews who were w her in da house n were consoling her, when they saw Mary--dat she stood up quickly n went out--followed her, cuz they thought dat she wuz goin’ 2 da tomb in order 2 cri there. 

Jn 11:32	Then Mary, when she came where Jesus wuz n saw him, fell at his feet, sayin’ 2 him, "Lord, if u had been here, my bro wouldn’t’ve died."
Jn 11:33	Then Jesus, when he saw her weepin’ n da Jews who came w her weepin’, wuz deeply moved in spirit n wuz troubled within himself.
Jn 11:34	And he said, "Where hav u laid him?" They said 2 him, "Lord, come n c."
Jn 11:35	Jesus cried.
Jn 11:36	So da Jews were sayin’, "C how he luvd him!"
Jn 11:37	But some of them said, "Wuz not dis man who opened da eyes of da blind able 2 do somethin’ so dat dis man also wouldn’t’ve died?" 

Jn 11:38	Then Jesus, deeply moved within himself again, came 2 da tomb. Now 'twas a cave, n a stone wuz lying on it.
Jn 11:39	Jesus said, "Take away da stone." Martha, da sister of da 1 who had died, said 2 him, "Lord, he’s stinking already, cuz it’s been 4 days."
Jn 11:40	Jesus said 2 her, "Did i not tell u dat if u believed, u would c da glory of God?"
Jn 11:41	So they took away da stone. And Jesus lifted up his eyes above n said, "Dad, i give thanks 2 u dat u hear me.
Jn 11:42	And i kno dat u always hear me, but 4 da sake of da crowd standing around i said it, so dat they may believe dat u sent me."
Jn 11:43	And when he had said deez tingz, he cried out w a loud voice, "Lazarus, come out!"
Jn 11:44	Da 1 who had died came out, his feet n his hands bound w strips of cloth, n his face wrapped w a facecloth. Jesus said 2 them, "Untie him n let him go." 

Jn 11:45	Then many of da Jews who had come w Mary n saw da tingz which he did believed in him.
Jn 11:46	But some of them went 2 da Pharisees n told them da tingz which Jesus had done.
Jn 11:47	So da chief priests n da Pharisees called together da Sanhedrin n said, "Wut r we doin’? Cuz of dis man is performing many signs!
Jn 11:48	If we allow him 2 go on in dis wey, e’erybody will believe in him, n da Romans will come n take away both our place n our nation." 

Jn 11:49	But a certain 1 of them, Caiaphas (who wuz high priest in dat yr), said 2 them, "U dunno anythin’ at all!
Jn 11:50	Nor do u consider dat it’s profitable 4 u dat 1 man shud die 4 da ppl, n da whole nation not die."
Jn 11:51	(Now he didn't say dis from himself, but bein’ high priest in dat yr, he prophesied dat Jesus wuz goin’ 2 die 4 da nation,
Jn 11:52	n not 4 da nation only, but also dat da kids of God who r scattered would be gathered into 1.)
Jn 11:53	So from dat day they resolved dat they shud kill him.
Jn 11:54	So Jesus wuz no longer walking openly among da Jews, but went away from there 2 da region near da wilderness, 2 a city called Ephraim, n there he stayed w da homies. 

Jn 11:55	Now da Passover of da Jews wuz near, n many went up 2 Jerusalem from da surrounding country b4 da Passover, so dat they could purify themselves.
Jn 11:56	So they were looking 4 Jesus, n were talkin’ w 1 anotha while standing in da temple courts, "Wut do u think? Dat he’ll not come 2 da feast?"
Jn 11:57	(Now da chief priests n da Pharisees had given orders dat if anyone knew where he wuz, they shud report it, so dat they could arrest him.) 


CHAPTER 12
Jn 12:1	Then, 6 days b4 da Passover, Jesus came 2 Bethany, where Lazarus wuz, whom Jesus had raised from da ded.
Jn 12:2	So they made him a dinner there, n Martha wuz serving, but Lazarus wuz 1 of da ones reclining at table w him.
Jn 12:3	Then Mary took a pound of ointment of valuable af genuine nard n anointed da feet of Jesus, n wiped his feet w her hair. And da house wuz filled w da fragrance of da ointment.
Jn 12:4	But Judas Iscariot, 1 of his homeboys (da 1 who wuz goin’ 2 betray him) said,
Jn 12:5	"Y wuz dis ointment not sold 4 3 hundred denarii n given 2 da poor?"
Jn 12:6	(Now he said dis not cuz he wuz concerned 'bout da poor, but cuz he wuz a thief, n having da money box, he used 2 steal wut wuz put into it.)
Jn 12:7	So Jesus said, "Leave her alone, so dat she may keep it 4 da day of my preparation 4 burial.
Jn 12:8	Cuz u hav da poor w u always, but u don’t always hav me." 

Jn 12:9	Now a large crowd of Jews found out dat he wuz there, n they came, not only cuz of Jesus, but so dat they could c Lazarus also, whom he raised from da ded.
Jn 12:10	So da chief priests decided dat they’d kill Lazarus also,
Jn 12:11	cuz on account of him many of da Jews were goin’ n believing in Jesus. 

Jn 12:12	On da next day da large crowd who had come 2 da feast, when they heard dat Jesus wuz comin’ 2 Jerusalem,
Jn 12:13	took da branches of palm trees n went out 2 meet him, n began crying out, 
 "Hosanna! Blessed is da 1 who comes in da name of da Lord, even da king of Israel!"

Jn 12:14	So Jesus found a yung donkey n sat on it, just like it’s written, 

Jn 12:15	"Don’t be afraid, daughter of Zion! Look, yo king is comin’, seated on da foal of a donkey!"

Jn 12:16	(His homeboys didn't understand deez tingz at 1st, but when Jesus wuz glorified, then they remembered dat deez tingz had been written 'bout him n they did deez tingz 2 him.)
Jn 12:17	So da crowd who wuz w him when he called Lazarus out of da tomb n raised him from da ded were continuing 2 testify.
Jn 12:18	Cuz of dis also da crowd went 2 meet him, 4 they had heard dat he had performed dis sign.
Jn 12:19	So da Pharisees said 2 1 anotha, "U c dat u r accomplishing nothin’! Look, da world haz gone after him." 

Jn 12:20	Now some Greeks were among those who had gone up in order 2 worship at da feast.
Jn 12:21	So deez approached Phil, who wuz from Bethsaida in Galilee, n began asking him sayin’, "Sir, we wanna c Jesus."
Jn 12:22	Phil went n told Andrew. Andrew n Phil went n told Jesus.
Jn 12:23	And Jesus answered them, sayin’, "Da hr haz come dat da Son of Man gonna be glorified.
Jn 12:24	Fr, tbh, unless a grain of wheat falls into da earth n dies, it remains by itself alone. But if it dies, it bears much fruit.
Jn 12:25	Da 1 who luvs his lyf loses it, n da 1 who hates his lyf in dis world preserves it 4 lyf 4ever.
Jn 12:26	If anyone serves me, he must follow me, n where im, there my servant gonna be also. If anyone serves me, da Dad will honor him. 

Jn 12:27	"Now my soul is troubled, n wut will i say? 'Dad, deliver me from dis hr'? But 4 dis reason i’ve come 2 dis hr!
Jn 12:28	Dad, glorify yo name!" Then a voice came from heaven, "i’ve both glorified it, n i’ll glorify it again."
Jn 12:29	Now da crowd dat stood there n heard it said it had thundered. Others were sayin’, "An angel haz spoken 2 him!"
Jn 12:30	Jesus answered n said, "Dis voice hasn't happened 4 my sake, but 4 yo sake.
Jn 12:31	Now is da judgment of dis world! Now da ruler of dis world gonna be yeeted out!
Jn 12:32	And i, when im lifted up from da earth, will draw all ppl 2 myself."
Jn 12:33	(Now he said dis 2 indicate by wut kinda death he wuz goin’ 2 die.) 

Jn 12:34	Then da crowd replied 2 him, "We hav heard from da law dat da Christ remains 4ever! And how do u say dat da Son of Man gotta be lifted up? Who is dis Son of Man?"
Jn 12:35	So Jesus said 2 them, "Yet a lil’ time da light is w u! Walk while u hav da light, so dat da darkness doesn't overtake u! And da 1 who walks in da darkness doesn't kno where he’s goin’.
Jn 12:36	While u hav da light, believe in da light, so dat u may become sons of light." Jesus said deez tingz, n then he went away n wuz hidden from them. 

Jn 12:37	But as many signs as he had performed b4 them, they didn't believe in him,
Jn 12:38	so dat da word of da prophet Isaiah would be fulfilled, who said, 
 "Lord, who haz believed our msg? And 2 whom haz da arm of da Lord been revealed?"

Jn 12:39	Cuz of dis reason they weren't able 2 believe, cuz again Isaiah said, 

Jn 12:40	"He haz blinded their eyes n hardened their hearts, lest they c w their eyes n understand w their hearts n turn, n i heal them."

Jn 12:41	Isaiah said deez tingz cuz he saw his glory, n he spoke 'bout him. 

Jn 12:42	Yet despite dat, even many of da rulers believed in him, but cuz of da Pharisees they didn't confess it, so dat they’d not be expelled from da synagogue.
Jn 12:43	Cuz they luvd da praise of men more than praise from God. 

Jn 12:44	But Jesus cried out n said, "Da 1 who believes in me doesn't believe in me, but in da 1 who sent me,
Jn 12:45	n da 1 who sees me sees da 1 who sent me.
Jn 12:46	i’ve come as a light into da world, so dat e’erybody who believes in me won’t remain in da darkness.
Jn 12:47	And if anyone hears my words n doesn't observe them, i’ll not judge him. Cuz i haven't come 2 judge da world, but 2 save da world.
Jn 12:48	Da 1 who rejects me n doesn't accept my words haz 1 who judges him; da word dat i’ve spoken will judge him on da last day.
Jn 12:49	Cuz i haven't spoken from myself, but da Dad himself who sent me haz commanded me wut i shud say n wut i shud talk.
Jn 12:50	And i kno dat his rule is lyf 4ever. So da tingz dat i say, just like da Dad said 2 me, so i say." 


CHAPTER 13
Jn 13:1	Now b4 da feast of Passover, Jesus, knowing dat his hr had come dat he’d depart from dis world 2 da Dad, n having luvd his own in da world, luvd them 2 da end.
Jn 13:2	And as a dinner wuz taking place, when da devil had already put into da heart of Judas son of Simon Iscariot dat he shud betray him,
Jn 13:3	cuz he knew dat da Dad had given him all tingz into his hands, n dat he had come forth from God n wuz goin’ away 2 God,
Jn 13:4	he got up from da dinner n took off his outer clothing, n taking a towel, tied it around himself.
Jn 13:5	Then he poured water into da washbasin n began 2 wash da feet of da homies, n 2 wipe them dry w da towel which he had tied around himself. 

Jn 13:6	Then he came 2 Simon Pete. He said 2 him, "Lord, r u goin’ 2 wash my feet?"
Jn 13:7	Jesus answered n said 2 him, "Wut im doin’ u don’t understand now, but u will understand after deez tingz."
Jn 13:8	Pete said 2 him, "U will never wash my feet 4ever!" Jesus replied 2 him, "Unless i wash u, u don’t hav a share w me."
Jn 13:9	Simon Pete said 2 him, "Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands n my head!"
Jn 13:10	Jesus said 2 him, "Da 1 who haz bathed only needs 2 wash his feet, but is totally clean. And u r clean, but not all of u."
Jn 13:11	(Cuz he knew da 1 who’d betray him; cuz of dis he said, "Not all of u r clean.") 

Jn 13:12	So when he had washed their feet n taken his outer clothing n reclined at table again, he said 2 them, "Do u understand wut i’ve done 4 u?
Jn 13:13	U call me 'Teacher' n 'Lord,' n u talk correctly, cuz im.
Jn 13:14	If then i--yo Lord n Teacher--wash yo feet, u also ought 2 wash 1 anotha's feet.
Jn 13:15	Cuz i’ve given u an example, dat just like i’ve done 4 u, u also do.
Jn 13:16	Fr, tbh, a slave isn’t better than his master, nor a messenger better than da 1 who sent him.
Jn 13:17	If u understand deez tingz, u r blessed if u do them. 

Jn 13:18	"i ain’t talkin’ 'bout all of u. i kno whom i’ve chosen, but so dat da scripture would be fulfilled, 'Da 1 who eats my bread haz lifted up his heel against me.'
Jn 13:19	From now on im telling u b4 it happens, so dat when it happens u may believe dat im he.
Jn 13:20	Fr, tbh, da 1 who receives anyone i send receives me, n da 1 who receives me receives da 1 who sent me." 

Jn 13:21	When he had said deez tingz, Jesus wuz troubled in spirit n testified n said, "Fr, tbh 1 of u will betray me."
Jn 13:22	Da homies began looking at 1 anotha, uncertain 'bout whom he wuz talkin’.
Jn 13:23	1 of his homies--da 1 whom Jesus luvd--wuz reclining close beside Jesus.
Jn 13:24	So Simon Pete gestured 4 dis 1 2 inquire who 'twas 'bout whom he wuz talkin’.
Jn 13:25	He leaned back accordingly against Jesus' chest n said 2 him, "Lord, who is it?"
Jn 13:26	Jesus replied, "It’s he 2 whom i dip da piece of bread n give it 2 him." Then after dipping da piece of bread, he gave it 2 Judas son of Simon Iscariot.
Jn 13:27	And after da piece of bread, then Satan entered into him. Then Jesus said 2 him, "Wut u r doin’, do quickly!"
Jn 13:28	(Now nobody of those reclining at table knew 4 wut reason he said dis 2 him.
Jn 13:29	Cuz some were thinking cuz Judas had da money box, Jesus wuz telling him, "Purchase wut we need 4 da feast," or dat he shud give somethin’ 2 da poor.)
Jn 13:30	So after he had taken da piece of bread, he went out immediately. And 'twas night. 

Jn 13:31	Then, when he had gone out, Jesus said, "Now da Son of Man is glorified, n God is glorified in him.
Jn 13:32	If God is glorified in him, God will also glorify him in himself, n will glorify him immediately.
Jn 13:33	Kids, yet a lil’ time im w u. U will seek me n just like i said 2 da Jews, "Where im goin’ u can’t come," now i say also 2 u. 

Jn 13:34	"A new rule i give 2 u: dat u luv 1 anotha--just like i’ve luvd u, dat u also luv 1 anotha.
Jn 13:35	By dis e’erybody will kno dat u r my homeboys--if u hav luv 4 1 anotha." 

Jn 13:36	Simon Pete said 2 him, "Lord, where r u goin’?" Jesus replied, "Where im goin’ u can’t follow me now, but u will follow later."
Jn 13:37	Pete said 2 him, "Lord, y am i not able 2 follow u now? i’ll lay down my lyf 4 u!"
Jn 13:38	Jesus replied, "Will u lay down yo lyf 4 me? Fr, tbh, da rooster won’t crow until u hav denied me 3 times! 


CHAPTER 14
Jn 14:1	"Don’t let yo hearts be troubled. U believe in God; believe also in me.
Jn 14:2	In my Dad's house there r many dwelling places; but if not, i’d hav told u, cuz im goin’ away 2 prepare a place 4 u.
Jn 14:3	And if i go n prepare a place 4 u, i’ll come again n get u 2 myself, so dat where im, u may be also.
Jn 14:4	And u kno da wae where im goin’." 

Jn 14:5	Tommy said 2 him, "Lord, we dunno where u r goin’. How r we able 2 kno da wae?"
Jn 14:6	Jesus said 2 him, "im da wey, n da truth, n da lyf. No 1 comes 2 da Dad except thru me.
Jn 14:7	If u had known me, u would’ve known my Dad also. From now on u kno him n hav seen him." 

Jn 14:8	Phil said 2 him, "Lord, show us da Dad, n it’s enough 4 us."
Jn 14:9	Jesus said 2 him, "Am i w u so long a time n u haven't known me, Phil? Da 1 who haz seen me haz seen da Dad! How can u say, 'Show us da Dad?'
Jn 14:10	Do u not believe dat im in da Dad n da Dad is in me? Da words dat i tell u i don’t talk from myself, but da Dad livin’ in me does his works.
Jn 14:11	Believe me dat im in da Dad n da Dad is in me; but if not, believe cuz of da works themselves.
Jn 14:12	Fr, tbh, da 1 who believes in me, da works dat im doin’ he’ll do also, n he’ll do better works than deez cuz im goin’ 2 da Dad.
Jn 14:13	And whatever u ask in my name, i’ll do dis, so dat da Dad may be glorified in da Son.
Jn 14:14	If u ask me anythin’ in my name, i’ll do it. 

Jn 14:15	"If u luv me, u will keep my rules.
Jn 14:16	And i’ll ask da Dad, n he’ll give u anotha Advocate, so dat he may be w u 4ever--
Jn 14:17	da Spirit of truth, whom da world isn’t able 2 get, cuz it doesn't c him or kno him. U kno him, cuz he lives w u n gonna be in u. 

Jn 14:18	"i’ll not leave u as orphans; im comin’ 2 u.
Jn 14:19	Yet a lil’ time n da world will c me no longer, but u will c me; cuz i live, u also will live.
Jn 14:20	On dat day u will kno dat im in my Dad, n u r in me, n im in u.
Jn 14:21	Da 1 who haz my rules n keeps them--dat 1 is da 1 who luvs me. And da 1 who luvs me gonna be luvd by my Dad, n i’ll luv him n will reveal myself 2 him." 

Jn 14:22	Judas (not Iscariot) said 2 him, "Lord, y is it dat u r goin’ 2 reveal yoself 2 us n not 2 da world?"
Jn 14:23	Jesus answered n said 2 him, "If anyone luvs me he’ll keep my word, n my Dad will luv him, n we'll come 2 him n will take up rez w him.
Jn 14:24	Da 1 who doesn't luv me doesn't keep my words, n da word dat u hear isn’t mine, but da Dad's who sent me.
Jn 14:25	Deez tingz i’ve spoken 2 u while livin’ w u.
Jn 14:26	But da Advocate, da Holy Spirit, whom da Dad will send in my name--dat 1 will teach u all tingz, n will remind u of everythin’ dat i said 2 u. 

Jn 14:27	"Pce i leave w u; my pce i give 2 u--not as da world gives, i give 2 u. Don’t let yo hearts be troubled, n don’t let them be afraid.
Jn 14:28	U hav heard dat i said 2 u, 'im goin’ away, n im comin’ 2 u.' If u luvd me, u would’ve rejoiced dat im goin’ 2 da Dad, cuz da Dad is better than im.
Jn 14:29	And now i’ve told u b4 it happens, so dat when it happens, u may believe.
Jn 14:30	i’ll no longer talk much w u, 4 da ruler of da world is comin’, n he’s no power over me.
Jn 14:31	But so dat da world may kno dat i luv da Dad, n just like da Dad haz commanded me, so im doin’. Get up, let’s go from here! 


CHAPTER 15
Jn 15:1	"im da tru vine, n my Dad is da vinedresser.
Jn 15:2	Every branch dat doesn't bear fruit in me, he removes it, n every branch dat bears fruit, he prunes it so dat it may bear more fruit.
Jn 15:3	U r already clean cuz of da word dat i’ve spoken 2 u.
Jn 15:4	Remain in me, n i in u. Just as da branch isn’t able 2 bear fruit from itself unless it remains in da vine, so neither can u, unless u remain in me. 

Jn 15:5	"im da vine; u r da branches. Da 1 who remains in me n i in him--dis 1 bears much fruit, 4 apart from me u aren’t able 2 do anythin’.
Jn 15:6	If anyone doesn't remain in me, he’s yeeted out as a branch, n dries up, n they gather them n yeet them into da fire, n they’re burned.
Jn 15:7	If u remain in me n my words remain in u, ask whatever u want n it gonna be done 4 u.
Jn 15:8	My Dad is glorified by dis: dat u bear much fruit, n prove 2 be my homies. 

Jn 15:9	"Just as da Dad haz luvd me, i also hav luvd u. Remain in my luv.
Jn 15:10	If u keep my rules, u will remain in my luv, just like i’ve kept my Dad's rules n remain in his luv.
Jn 15:11	i’ve spoken deez tingz 2 u so dat my happiness may be in u, n yo happiness may be made complete.
Jn 15:12	Dis is my rule: dat u luv 1 anotha just like i’ve luvd u.
Jn 15:13	No 1 haz better luv than dis: dat someone lay down his lyf 4 his friends.
Jn 15:14	U r my friends if u do wut i command u.
Jn 15:15	No longer do i call u slaves, cuz da slave doesn't kno wut his master is doin’. But i’ve called u friends, cuz everythin’ dat i’ve heard from my Dad i’ve revealed 2 u.
Jn 15:16	U didn't choose me, but i chose u n appointed u dat u shud go n bear fruit, n yo fruit shud remain, so dat whatever u ask da Dad in my name he’ll give u.
Jn 15:17	Deez tingz i command u: dat u luv 1 anotha. 

Jn 15:18	If da world hates u, u kno dat it’s hated me b4 it hated u.
Jn 15:19	If u were of da world, da world would luv its own. But cuz u aren’t of da world, but i chose u out of da world, 4 dis reason da world hates u.
Jn 15:20	Remember da word dat i said 2 u: 'A slave isn’t better than his master.' If they persecuted me, they’ll also persecute u. If they kept my word, they’ll keep urs also.
Jn 15:21	But they’ll do all deez tingz 2 u on account of my name, cuz they dunno da 1 who sent me.
Jn 15:22	If i hadn't come n spoken 2 them, they’d not hav sin. But now they don’t hav a valid excuse 4 their sin.
Jn 15:23	Da 1 who hates me hates my Dad also.
Jn 15:24	If i hadn't done among them da works dat nobody else did, they’d not hav sin. But now they hav both seen n hated both me n my Dad.
Jn 15:25	But dis happened so dat da word dat’s written in their law would be fulfilled, 'They hated me without a reason.' 

Jn 15:26	"When da Advocate comes, whom i’ll send 2 u from da Dad--da Spirit of truth, who proceeds from da Dad--dat 1 will testify 'bout me.
Jn 15:27	And u also will testify, cuz u hav been w me from da beginning. 


CHAPTER 16
Jn 16:1	"i’ve said deez tingz 2 u so dat u won’t fall away.
Jn 16:2	They will expel u from da synagogue, but an hr is comin’ dat e’erybody who kills u will think they’re offering service 2 God.
Jn 16:3	And they’ll do deez tingz cuz they dunno da Dad or me.
Jn 16:4	But i’ve said deez tingz 2 u so dat when their hr comes, u may remember dat i told u 'bout them. 

Jn 16:5	But now im goin’ away 2 da 1 who sent me, n none of u is asking me, 'Where r u goin’?'
Jn 16:6	But cuz i’ve said deez tingz 2 u, sadness haz filled yo hearts.
Jn 16:7	But i tell u da truth, it’s better 4 u dat i go away. Cuz if i don’t go away, da Advocate won’t come 2 u; but if i go, i’ll send him 2 u.
Jn 16:8	And when he comes, he’ll convict da world abt sin n abt righteousness n abt judgment:
Jn 16:9	abt sin, cuz they don’t believe in me,
Jn 16:10	n abt righteousness, cuz im goin’ away 2 da Dad n u will c me no more,
Jn 16:11	n abt judgment, cuz da ruler of dis world haz been condemned. 

Jn 16:12	i still hav many tingz 2 tell u, but u aren’t able 2 bear them now.
Jn 16:13	But when he--da Spirit of truth--comes, he’ll guide u into all da truth. Cuz he’ll not talk from himself, but whatever he hears he’ll talk, n he’ll proclaim 2 u da tingz 2 come.
Jn 16:14	He will glorify me, cuz he’ll take from wut is mine n will proclaim it 2 u.
Jn 16:15	Everythin’ dat da Dad haz is mine. Cuz of dis reason i said dat he takes from wut is mine n will proclaim it 2 u. 

Jn 16:16	"A lil’ while n u will c me no more, n again a lil’ while n u will c me.
Jn 16:17	So some of his homeboys said 2 1 anotha, "Wut is dis dat he’s sayin’ 2 us, 'A lil’ while n u won’t c me, n again a lil’ while n u will c me,' n 'Cuz im goin’ away 2 da Dad'?"
Jn 16:18	So they kept on sayin’, "Wut is dis dat he’s sayin’, 'A lil’ while'? We don’t understand wut he’s talkin’ 'bout!" 

Jn 16:19	Jesus knew dat they were wanting 2 ask him, n he said 2 them, "R u deliberating w 1 anotha 'bout dis--dat i said, 'A lil’ while, n u won’t c me, n again a lil’ while n u will c me'?
Jn 16:20	Fr, tbh, dat u will cri n be sad, but da world will rejoice; u will become sad, but yo sadness will change 2 happiness.
Jn 16:21	A woman, when she gives birth, experiences pain cuz her hr haz come. But when her kid is born, she no longer remembers da affliction, on account of da happiness dat a human bein’ haz been born into da world.
Jn 16:22	So u also r experiencing sadness now, but i’ll c u again, n yo hearts will rejoice, n nobody will take away yo happiness from u.
Jn 16:23	And on dat day u will ask me nothin’. Fr, tbh, whatever u ask da Dad in my name, he’ll give u.
Jn 16:24	Until now u hav asked nothin’ in my name. Ask n u will get, so dat yo happiness may be complete. 

Jn 16:25	"i’ve said deez tingz 2 u in figurative sayings. An hr is comin’ when i’ll talk 2 u in figurative sayings no longer, but i’ll tell u straight 'bout da Dad.
Jn 16:26	On dat day u will ask in my name, n i don’t tell u dat i’ll ask da Dad on yo behalf.
Jn 16:27	Cuz da Dad himself luvs u, cuz u hav luvd me n hav believed dat i came from God.
Jn 16:28	i’ve gone out from da Dad n hav come into da world; again, im leaving da world n am goin’ 2 da Dad." 

Jn 16:29	His homies said, "Look, now u r talkin’ straight n r telling us no figurative sayin’!
Jn 16:30	Now we kno dat u kno everythin’ n don’t need 4 anyone 2 ask u questions. By dis we believe dat u hav come from God." 

Jn 16:31	Jesus replied 2 them, "Now do u believe?
Jn 16:32	Look, an hr is comin’--n haz come--dat u gonna be scattered each 1 2 his own home, n u will leave me alone. And i ain’t alone, cuz da Dad is w me.
Jn 16:33	i’ve said deez tingz 2 u so dat in me u may hav pce. In da world u hav affliction, but hav courage! i’ve conquered da world." 


CHAPTER 17
Jn 17:1	Jesus said deez tingz, n lifting up his eyes 2 heaven he said, "Dad, da hr haz come! Glorify yo Son, so dat yo Son may glorify u--
Jn 17:2	just like u hav given him authority over all flesh, so dat he’d give lyf 4ever 2 them--e’erybody whom u hav given him.
Jn 17:3	Now dis is lyf 4ever: dat they kno u, da only tru God, n JC, whom u hav sent.
Jn 17:4	i’ve glorified u on earth by completing da work dat u hav given me 2 do.
Jn 17:5	And now, Dad, u glorify me at yo side w da glory dat i had at yo side b4 da world existed. 

Jn 17:6	"i’ve revealed yo name 2 da men whom u gave me out of da world. They were urs, n u hav given them 2 me, n they hav kept yo word.
Jn 17:7	Now they understand dat all da tingz dat u hav given me r from u,
Jn 17:8	cuz da words dat u gave 2 me i’ve given 2 them, n they received them n kno fr dat i’ve come from u, n they hav believed dat u hav sent me.
Jn 17:9	im asking on behalf of them. i ain’t asking on behalf of da world, but on behalf of those whom u hav given me, cuz they’re urs,
Jn 17:10	n all my tingz r urs, n yo tingz r mine, n i’ve been glorified in them.
Jn 17:11	And im no longer in da world, n they’re in da world, n im comin’ 2 u. Holy Dad, keep them in yo name, which u hav given 2 me, so dat they may be 1, just like we're.
Jn 17:12	When i wuz w them, i kept them in yo name, which u hav given 2 me, n guarded them, n none of them haz died except da son of destruction, so dat da scripture would be fulfilled.
Jn 17:13	And now im comin’ 2 u, n im sayin’ deez tingz in da world so dat they may hav my happiness completed in themselves.
Jn 17:14	i’ve given them yo word, n da world haz hated them, cuz they aren’t of da world just like i ain’t of da world.
Jn 17:15	i don’t ask dat u take them out of da world, but dat u protect them from da bad 1.
Jn 17:16	They aren’t of da world, just like i ain’t of da world.
Jn 17:17	Sanctify them in da truth--yo word is truth.
Jn 17:18	Just as u sent me into da world, i also hav sent them into da world.
Jn 17:19	And 4 them i sanctify myself, so dat they themselves also may be sanctified in da truth. 

Jn 17:20	"And i don’t ask on behalf of deez only, but also on behalf of those who believe in me thru their word,
Jn 17:21	dat they all may be 1, just like u, Dad, r in me n im in u, dat they also may be in us, so dat da world may believe dat u sent me.
Jn 17:22	And da glory dat u hav given 2 me, i’ve given 2 them, so dat they may be 1, just like we're 1--
Jn 17:23	i in them, n u in me, so dat they may be completed in 1, so dat da world may kno dat u sent me, n u hav luvd them just like u hav luvd me. 

Jn 17:24	"Dad, those whom u hav given 2 me--i want dat those also may be w me where im, so dat they may c my glory dat u hav given me cuz u luvd me b4 da foundation of da world.
Jn 17:25	Gud Dad, even tho da world doesn't kno u, yet i’ve known u, n deez men hav come 2 kno dat u sent me.
Jn 17:26	And i made known 2 them yo name, n will make it known, so dat da luv w which u luvd me may be in them, n i may be in them." 


CHAPTER 18
Jn 18:1	When Jesus had said deez tingz, he went out w his homies 2 da other side of da ravine of da Kidron, where there wuz a garden into which he n his homies entered.
Jn 18:2	(Now Judas, da 1 who betrayed him, also knew 'bout da place, cuz Jesus often gathered there w his homeboys.)
Jn 18:3	So Judas, taking da cohort n officers from da chief priests n from da Pharisees, came there w lanterns n torches n weapons.
Jn 18:4	Then Jesus, cuz he knew all da tingz dat were comin’ on him, went out n said 2 them, "Who r u looking 4?"
Jn 18:5	They replied 2 him, "Jesus da Nazarene." He said 2 them, "im he." (Now Judas, da 1 who betrayed him, wuz also standing w them.)
Jn 18:6	So when he said 2 them, "im he," they drew back n fell 2 da ground.
Jn 18:7	Then he asked them again, "Who r u looking 4?" And they said, "Jesus da Nazarene."
Jn 18:8	Jesus replied, "i said 2 u dat im he! So if u r looking 4 me, let deez men go,"
Jn 18:9	so dat da word dat he had spoken would be fulfilled: "Those whom u hav given 2 me--i haven't lost anyone of them." 

Jn 18:10	Then Simon Pete, who had a sword, drew it n struck da slave of da high priest n cut off his right ear. (Now da name of da slave wuz Malchus.)
Jn 18:11	So Jesus said 2 Pete, "Put da sword into its sheath! Da cup dat da Dad haz given me--will i not drink it?" 

Jn 18:12	Then da cohort n da military tribune n da officers of da Jews seized Jesus n tied him up,
Jn 18:13	n brought him 2 Annas 1st, 4 he wuz da dad-in-law of Caiaphas, who wuz high priest dat yr.
Jn 18:14	(Now 'twas Caiaphas who had advised da Jews dat 'twas better dat 1 man die 4 da ppl.) 

Jn 18:15	So Simon Pete n anotha homie followed Jesus. (Now dat homeboy wuz known 2 da high priest, n entered w Jesus into da courtyard of da high priest.)
Jn 18:16	But Pete wuz standing by da door outside. So da other homie who wuz known 2 da high priest went out n spoke 2 da doorkeeper n brought Pete in.
Jn 18:17	Then da female slave who wuz da doorkeeper said 2 Pete, "U aren’t also 1 of da homies of dis man, r u?" He said, "i ain’t!"
Jn 18:18	(Now da slaves n da officers were standing there, having made a charcoal fire cuz 'twas cold, n they were warming themselves. And Pete wuz also standing there w them n warming himself.) 

Jn 18:19	So da high priest questioned Jesus 'bout his homeboys n 'bout his teaching.
Jn 18:20	Jesus replied 2 him, "i’ve spoken openly 2 da world. i always taught in da synagogue n in da temple courts where all da Jews assemble, n i’ve said nothin’ in secret.
Jn 18:21	Y r u asking me? Ask those who heard wut i’ve said 2 them! Look, deez ppl kno wut i said."
Jn 18:22	Now when he had said deez tingz, 1 of da officers who wuz standing by gave a slap in da face 2 Jesus, sayin’, "Do u reply 2 da high priest in dis wae?"
Jn 18:23	Jesus replied 2 him, "If i’ve spoken wrongly, testify 'bout wut is wrong! But if i’ve spoken correctly, y do u hit me?"
Jn 18:24	Then Annas sent him, tied up, 2 Caiaphas da high priest. 

Jn 18:25	Now Simon Pete wuz standing there n warming himself. So they said 2 him, "U aren’t also 1 of his homies, r u?" He denied it n said, "i ain’t!"
Jn 18:26	1 of da slaves of da high priest, who wuz related 2 da 1 whose ear Pete had cut off, said, "Did i not c u in da garden w him?"
Jn 18:27	So Pete denied it again, n immediately a rooster crowed. 

Jn 18:28	Then they brought Jesus from Caiaphas 2 da governor's rez. Now 'twas early, n they didn't enter into da governor's rez so dat they’d not be defiled, but could eat da Passover.
Jn 18:29	So Pilate came outside 2 them n said, "Wut accusation do u bring against dis man?"
Jn 18:30	They answered n said 2 him, "If dis man weren't doin’ bad, we’d not hav handed him over 2 u!"
Jn 18:31	So Pilate said 2 them, "U take him n judge him accordin’ 2 yo law!" Da Jews said 2 him, "It isn’t ok 4 us 2 kill anyone,"
Jn 18:32	so dat da word of Jesus would be fulfilled dat he had spoken, indicating by wut kinda death he wuz goin’ 2 die. 

Jn 18:33	Then Pilate entered again into da governor's rez n summoned Jesus n said 2 him, "R u da king of da Jews?"
Jn 18:34	Jesus replied, "Do u say dis from yoself, or hav others said dis 2 u 'bout me?"
Jn 18:35	Pilate replied, "i ain’t a Jew, am i? Yo ppl n da chief priests handed u over 2 me! Wut hav u done?"
Jn 18:36	Jesus replied, "My kingdom isn’t of dis world. If my kingdom were of dis world, my servants would be fighting so dat i’d not be handed over 2 da Jews. But now my kingdom isn’t from here."
Jn 18:37	Then Pilate said 2 him, "So then u r a king!" Jesus replied, "U say dat im a king. Cuz of dis reason i wuz born, n 4 dis reason i’ve come into da world: so dat i can testify 2 da truth. E’erybody who is of da truth hears my voice."
Jn 18:38	Pilate said 2 him, "Wut is truth?" 
 And when he had said dis, he went out again 2 da Jews n said 2 them, "i find no basis 4 an accusation against him.
Jn 18:39	But it’s yo custom dat i release 4 u 1 prisoner at da Passover. So do u want me 2 release 4 u da king of da Jews?"
Jn 18:40	Then they shouted again, sayin’, "Not dis man, but Barabbas!" (Now Barabbas wuz a revolutionary.) 


CHAPTER 19
Jn 19:1	So then Pilate took Jesus n had him whipped.
Jn 19:2	And da soldiers wove a crown of thorns n placed it on his head, n put a purple robe on him,
Jn 19:3	n were comin’ up 2 him n sayin’, "Hail, king of da Jews!" n were giving him slaps in da face. 

Jn 19:4	And Pilate came outside again n said 2 them, "Look, im bringing him outside 2 u, so dat u will kno dat i find no basis 4 an accusation against him."
Jn 19:5	Then Jesus came outside wearing da crown of thorns n da purple robe, n he said 2 them, "Look da man!"
Jn 19:6	So when they saw him, da chief priests n da officers shouted, sayin’, "Crucify! Crucify!" Pilate said 2 them, "U take him n crucify him! Cuz i don’t find a basis 4 an accusation against him."
Jn 19:7	Da Jews replied 2 him, "We hav a law, n accordin’ 2 da law he ought 2 die, cuz he made himself out 2 be da Son of God!" 

Jn 19:8	So when Pilate heard dis statement, he wuz even more afraid,
Jn 19:9	n he entered into da governor's rez again n said 2 Jesus, "Where r u from?" But Jesus didn't give him an answer.
Jn 19:10	So Pilate said 2 him, "Will u not talk 2 me? Do u not kno dat i’ve authority 2 release u, n i’ve authority 2 crucify u?"
Jn 19:11	Jesus replied 2 him, "U wouldn’t’ve any authority over me unless 'twas given 2 u from above. Cuz of dis reason da 1 who handed me over 2 u haz better sin." 

Jn 19:12	From dis point on Pilate wuz seeking 2 release him, but da Jews shouted, sayin’, "If u release dis man, u aren’t a friend of Caesar! E’erybody who makes himself out 2 be a king opposes Caesar!"
Jn 19:13	So Pilate, when he heard deez words, brought Jesus outside n sat down on da judgment seat, in da place called Da Stone Pavement (but Gabbatha in Aramaic).
Jn 19:14	(Now 'twas da day of preparation of da Passover; 'twas 'bout da 6th hr.) And he said 2 da Jews, "Look yo king!" 

Jn 19:15	Then those shouted, "Away w him! Away w him! Crucify him!" Pilate said 2 them, "Will i crucify yo king?" Da chief priests replied, "We don’t hav a king except Caesar!"
Jn 19:16	So then he handed him over 2 them so dat he could be crucified. 

Jn 19:17	n carrying 4 himself da cross, he went out 2 da place called Da Place of a Skull (which is called Golgotha in Aramaic),
Jn 19:18	where they crucified him, n w him 2 others, 1 on each side, n Jesus in da middle.
Jn 19:19	And Pilate also wrote a notice n placed it on da cross, n 'twas written: "Jesus da Nazarene, da king of da Jews."
Jn 19:20	So many of da Jews read dis notice, cuz da place where Jesus wuz crucified wuz near da city. And 'twas written in Aramaic, in Latin, n in Greek.
Jn 19:21	Then da chief priests of da Jews said 2 Pilate, "Don’t write 'Da king of da Jews,' but, 'He said, im king of da Jews.'"
Jn 19:22	Pilate replied, "Wut i’ve written, i’ve written." 

Jn 19:23	Then da soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his clothing n made 4 shares--4 each soldier a share--n da tunic. (Now da tunic wuz seamless, woven from da top in a single piece.)
Jn 19:24	So they said 2 1 anotha, "Let us not tear it apart, but cast lots 4 it, 2 c whose it gonna be," so dat da scripture would be fulfilled dat says, 
 "They divided my garments among themselves, n 4 my clothing they cast lots."
 So da soldiers did deez tingz. 

Jn 19:25	Now his mom n da sister of his mom, Mary da wife of Clopas, n Mary Magdalene were standing near da cross of Jesus.
Jn 19:26	So Jesus, seeing his mom n da homie whom he luvd standing there, said 2 his mom, "Woman, look yo son!"
Jn 19:27	Then he said 2 da homie, "Look yo mom!" And from dat hr da homeboy took her into his own home. 

Jn 19:28	After dis, Jesus, knowing dat now at last everythin’ wuz completed, so dat da scripture would be fulfilled, said, "im thirsty."
Jn 19:29	A jar full of sour wine wuz standing there, so they put a sponge full of da sour wine on a branch of hyssop n brought it 2 his mouth.
Jn 19:30	Then when he had received da sour wine, Jesus said, "It’s completed," n bowing his head, he gave up his spirit. 

Jn 19:31	Then da Jews, cuz 'twas da day of preparation, so dat da bodies would not remain on da cross on da Sabbath (4 dat Sabbath wuz an important day), asked Pilate dat their legs could be broken n they could be taken away.
Jn 19:32	So da soldiers came n broke da legs of da 1st n of da other who had been crucified w him.
Jn 19:33	But when they came 2 Jesus, after they saw he wuz already ded, they didn't break his legs.
Jn 19:34	But 1 of da soldiers pierced his side w a spear, n blood n water came out immediately.
Jn 19:35	And da 1 who haz seen it’s testified, n his testimony is tru, n dat person knows dat he’s telling da truth, so dat u also may believe.
Jn 19:36	Cuz deez tingz happened so dat da scripture would be fulfilled: "None of his bones gonna be broken."
Jn 19:37	And again anotha scripture says, "They will look on da 1 whom they hav pierced." 

Jn 19:38	And after deez tingz, Joey who wuz from Arimathea, who wuz a homie of Jesus (but a secret 1 4 fear of da Jews), asked Pilate dat he might take away da body of Jesus. And Pilate allowed it, so he came n took away his body.
Jn 19:39	And Nicodemus--da 1 who had come 2 him formerly at night--also came, bringing a mixture of myrrh n aloes weighing 'bout a hundred pounds.
Jn 19:40	So they took da body of Jesus n wrapped it in strips of linen cloth w da fragrant spices, as is da Jews' custom 2 prepare 4 burial.
Jn 19:41	Now there wuz a garden at da place where he wuz crucified, n in da garden a new tomb in which nobody wuz yet buried.
Jn 19:42	So there, on account of da day of preparation of da Jews, cuz da tomb wuz close by, they buried Jesus. 


CHAPTER 20
Jn 20:1	Now on da 1st day of da week, Mary Magdalene came 2 da tomb early, while 'twas still dark, n saw da stone had been taken away from da tomb.
Jn 20:2	So she ran n came 2 Simon Pete n 2 da other homie whom Jesus luvd n said 2 them, "They hav taken away da Lord from da tomb n we dunno where they hav put him!"
Jn 20:3	Then Pete n da other homeboy went out n were goin’ 2 da tomb.
Jn 20:4	And da 2 were running together, n da other homeboy ran ahead, faster than Pete, n came 2 da tomb 1st.
Jn 20:5	And bending over 2 look, he saw da strips of linen cloth lying there, though he didn't go in.
Jn 20:6	Then Simon Pete also came following him, n he went into da tomb n saw da strips of linen cloth lying there,
Jn 20:7	n da facecloth dat wuz on his head--not lying w da strips of linen cloth, but folded up separately in 1 place.
Jn 20:8	So then da other homeboy who had come 2 da tomb 1st also went in, n he saw n believed.
Jn 20:9	(Cuz they didn't yet kno da scripture dat 'twas necessary 4 him 2 rise from da ded.) 

Jn 20:10	Then da homeboys went away again 2 their own homes.
Jn 20:11	But Mary stood outside at da tomb, weepin’. Then, while she wuz weepin’, she bent over 2 look into da tomb,
Jn 20:12	n she saw 2 angels in white, seated 1 at da head n 1 at da feet where da body of Jesus had been lying.
Jn 20:13	And they said 2 her, "Woman, y r u weepin’?" She said 2 them, "They hav taken away my Lord, n idk where they hav put him!"
Jn 20:14	When she had said deez tingz, she turned around n saw Jesus standing there, n she didn't kno dat 'twas Jesus. 

Jn 20:15	Jesus said 2 her, "Woman, y r u weepin’? Who r u looking 4?" She thought dat 'twas da gardener, n said 2 him, "Sir, if u hav carried him away, tell me where u hav put him, n i’ll take him."
Jn 20:16	Jesus said 2 her, "Mary." She turned around n said 2 him in Aramaic, "Rabboni" (which means "Teacher").
Jn 20:17	Jesus said 2 her, "Don’t touch me, cuz i haven't yet went up 2 da Dad. But go 2 my bros n tell them, 'im goin’ up 2 my Dad n yo Dad, n my God n yo God.'"
Jn 20:18	Mary Magdalene came n announced 2 da homies, "i’ve seen da Lord," n he had said deez tingz 2 her. 

Jn 20:19	Now when 'twas evening on dat day--da 1st day of da week--n da doors had been shut where da homeboys were cuz of fear of da Jews, Jesus came n stood in their midst n said 2 them, "Pce 2 u."
Jn 20:20	And when he had said dis, he showed his hands n his side 2 them. Then da homeboys rejoiced when they saw da Lord.
Jn 20:21	So Jesus said 2 them again, "Pce 2 u. As da Dad haz sent me, i also send u."
Jn 20:22	And when he had said dis, he breathed on them n said 2 them, "Get da Holy Spirit.
Jn 20:23	If u forgive da sins of any, they’re forgiven them. If u retain da sins of any, they’re retained." 

Jn 20:24	Now Tommy, 1 of da 12, who wuz called Didymus, wasn’t w them when Jesus came.
Jn 20:25	So da other homeboys said 2 him, "We hav seen da Lord!" But he said 2 them, "Unless i c in his hands da mark of da nails, n put my finger into da mark of da nails, n put my hand into his side, i’ll never believe!" 

Jn 20:26	And after 8 days his homies were again inside, n Tommy w them. Even tho da doors had been shut, Jesus came n stood in their midst n said, "Pce 2 u."
Jn 20:27	Then he said 2 Tommy, "Place yo finger here n c my hands, n place yo hand n put it into my side. And don’t be unbelieving, but believing!"
Jn 20:28	Tommy answered n said 2 him, "My Lord n my God!"
Jn 20:29	Jesus said 2 him, "Cuz u hav seen me, hav u believed? Blessed r those who haven't seen n hav believed." 

Jn 20:30	Now Jesus also performed many other signs in da presence of da homeboys which aren’t recorded in dis book,
Jn 20:31	but deez tingz r recorded so dat u may believe dat Jesus is da Christ, da Son of God, n dat by believing u may hav lyf in his name. 


CHAPTER 21
Jn 21:1	After deez tingz Jesus revealed himself again 2 da homeboys by da Sea of Tiberias. Now he revealed himself in dis wae:
Jn 21:2	Simon Pete n Tommy (who wuz called Didymus) n Nathanael from Cana in Galilee n da sons of Zebedee n 2 others of his homies were together.
Jn 21:3	Simon Pete said 2 them, "im goin’ fishing!" They said 2 him, "We also r comin’ w u." They went out n got into da boat, n during dat night they caught nothin’. 

Jn 21:4	Now when 'twas already early mornin’, Jesus stood on da beach. However, da homeboys didn't kno dat 'twas Jesus.
Jn 21:5	So Jesus said 2 them, "Kids, u don’t hav any fish 2 eat, do u? They answered him, "No."
Jn 21:6	And he said 2 them, "Yeet da net on da right side of da boat, n u will find some." So they yote it, n were no longer able 2 haul it in from da large numba of da fish. 

Jn 21:7	Then dat homie whom Jesus luvd said 2 Pete, "It’s da Lord!" So Simon Pete, when he heard dat 'twas da Lord, tied around himself his outer garment (4 he wuz nude) n yote himself into da sea.
Jn 21:8	But da other homeboys came in da boat, dragging da net of fish, cuz they weren't far from da land, but 'bout 2 hundred cubits away. 

Jn 21:9	So when they got out on da land, they saw a charcoal fire laid there, n a fish lying on it, n bread.
Jn 21:10	Jesus said 2 them, "Bring some of da fish dat u hav just now caught."
Jn 21:11	So Simon Pete got into da boat n hauled da net 2 da land, full of large fish--1 hundred fifty-3--n even tho there were so many, da net wasn’t torn.
Jn 21:12	Jesus said 2 them, "Come, eat breakfast!" But none of da homies dared 2 ask him, "Who r u?" cuz they knew dat 'twas da Lord.
Jn 21:13	Jesus came n took da bread n gave it 2 them, n da fish like dat.
Jn 21:14	Dis wuz now da 3rd time Jesus wuz revealed 2 da homies after he had been raised from da ded. 

Jn 21:15	Now when they had eaten breakfast, Jesus said 2 Simon Pete, "Simon son of Johnny, do u luv me more than deez?" He said 2 him, "Yeah, Lord, u kno dat i luv u." He said 2 him, "Feed my lambs!"
Jn 21:16	He said 2 him again a 2nd time, "Simon son of Johnny, do u luv me?" He said 2 him, "Yeah, Lord, u kno dat i luv u." He said 2 him, "Shepherd my sheep!"
Jn 21:17	He said 2 him a 3rd time, "Simon son of Johnny, do u luv me?" Pete wuz distressed cuz he said 2 him a 3rd time, "Do u luv me?" n he said 2 him, "Lord, u kno everythin’! U kno dat i luv u!" Jesus said 2 him, "Feed my sheep!
Jn 21:18	Fr, tbh, when u were yung, u tied yo clothes around yoself n walked wherever u wanted. But when u grow old, u will stretch out yo hands, n someone else will tie u up n carry u where u don’t wanna go.
Jn 21:19	(Now he said dis 2 indicate by wut kind of death he’d glorify God.) And after he had said dis, he said 2 him, "Follow me!" 

Jn 21:20	Pete turned n saw da homie whom Jesus luvd following them (who also leaned back on his chest at da dinner n said, "Lord, who is da 1 betraying u?")
Jn 21:21	So when he saw dis 1, Pete said 2 Jesus, "Lord, but wut 'bout dis 1?"
Jn 21:22	Jesus said 2 him, "If i want him 2 remain until i come, wut is dat 2 u? U follow me!"
Jn 21:23	So dis sayin’ went out 2 da bros dat dat homie would not die. But Jesus didn't tell him dat he’d not die, but "If i want him 2 remain until i come, wut is dat 2 u?" 

Jn 21:24	Dis is da homie who is testifying 'bout deez tingz, n who haz written down deez tingz. And we kno dat his testimony is tru.
Jn 21:25	Now there r also many other tingz dat Jesus did, which--if they were written down 1 after da other--i suppose not even da world itself could contain da books dat’d be written.
