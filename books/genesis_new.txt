----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CHAPTER 1
Ge 1:1	In da beginning, God created da heavens n da earth--
Ge 1:2	Now da earth wuz formless n empty, n darkness wuz over da face of da deep. And da Spirit of God wuz hovering over da surface of da waters.
Ge 1:3	And God said, "Let there be light!" And there wuz light.
Ge 1:4	And God saw da light, dat 'twas aight, n God caused there 2 be a separation between da light n between da darkness.
Ge 1:5	And God called da light Day, n da darkness he called Night. And there wuz evening n there wuz mornin’, da 1st day. 

Ge 1:6	And God said, "Let there be a vaulted dome in da midst of da waters, n let it cause a separation between da waters."
Ge 1:7	So God made da vaulted dome, n he caused a separation between da waters which were under da vaulted dome n between da waters which were over da vaulted dome. And 'twas so.
Ge 1:8	And God called da vaulted dome "heaven." And there wuz evening, n there wuz mornin’, a 2nd day. 

Ge 1:9	And God said, "Let da waters under heaven be gathered 2 1 place, n let da dry ground appear." And 'twas so.
Ge 1:10	And God called da dry ground "earth," n he called da collection of da waters "seas." And God saw dat 'twas aight.
Ge 1:11	And God said, "Let da earth produce green plants dat’ll bear seed--fruit trees bearing fruit in which there’s seed--accordin’ 2 its kind, on da earth." And 'twas so.
Ge 1:12	And da earth brought forth green plants bearing seed accordin’ 2 its kind, n trees bearing fruit in which there wuz seed accordin’ 2 its kind. And God saw dat 'twas aight.
Ge 1:13	And there wuz evening n there wuz mornin’, a 3rd day. 

Ge 1:14	And God said, "Let there be lights in da vaulted dome of heaven 2 separate day from night, n let them be as signs n 4 appointed times, n 4 days n yrs,
Ge 1:15	n they’ll be as lights in da vaulted dome of heaven 2 give light on da earth." And 'twas so.
Ge 1:16	And God made 2 lights, da better light 2 rule da day n da smoler light 2 rule da night, n da stars.
Ge 1:17	And God placed them in da vaulted dome of heaven 2 give light on da earth
Ge 1:18	n 2 rule over da day n over da night, n 2 separate light from darkness. And God saw dat 'twas aight.
Ge 1:19	And there wuz evening n there wuz mornin’, a 4th day. 

Ge 1:20	And God said, "Let da waters swarm w swarms of livin’ creatures, n let birbs fly over da earth across da face of da vaulted dome of heaven.
Ge 1:21	So God created da great sea creatures n every livin’ creature dat moves, w which da waters swarm, accordin’ 2 their kind, n every birb w wings accordin’ 2 its kind. And God saw dat 'twas aight.
Ge 1:22	And God blessed them, sayin’, "Be fruitful n multiply, n fill da waters in da seas, n let da birbs multiply on da earth."
Ge 1:23	And there wuz evening, n there wuz mornin’, a 5th day. 

Ge 1:24	And God said, "Let da earth bring forth livin’ creatures accordin’ 2 their kind: cattle n moving tingz, n wild animals accordin’ 2 their kind." And 'twas so.
Ge 1:25	So God made wild animals accordin’ 2 their kind n da cattle accordin’ 2 their kind, n every creeping thang of da earth accordin’ 2 its kind. And God saw dat 'twas aight. 

Ge 1:26	And God said, "Let us make humankind in our image n accordin’ 2 our likeness, n let them rule over da fish of da sea, n over da birbs of heaven, n over da cattle, n over all da earth, n over every moving thang dat moves on da earth."
Ge 1:27	So God created humankind in his image, in da likeness of God he created him, male n female he created them.
Ge 1:28	And God blessed them, n God said 2 them, "Be fruitful n multiply, n fill da earth n subdue it, n rule over da fish of da sea n da birbs of heaven, n over every animal dat moves on da earth." 

Ge 1:29	And God said, "Look--im giving 2 u every plant dat bears seed which is on da face of da whole earth, n every kind of tree dat bears fruit. They will be urs as food."
Ge 1:30	And 2 every kind of animal of da earth n 2 every birb of heaven, n 2 everythin’ dat moves on da earth in which there’s lyf im giving every green plant as food." And 'twas so.
Ge 1:31	And God saw everythin’ dat he had made n, look, 'twas gud af. And there wuz evening, n there wuz mornin’, a 6th day. 


CHAPTER 2
Ge 2	
Ge 2:1	And heaven n earth n all their array were finished.
Ge 2:2	And on da 7th day God finished his work dat he had done, n he rested on da 7th day from all his work dat he had done.
Ge 2:3	And God blessed da 7th day, n he sanctified it, cuz on it he rested from all his work of creating dat there wuz 2 do. 

Ge 2:4	Deez r da gens of heaven n earth when they were created, in da day dat YHWH God made earth n heaven--
Ge 2:5	b4 any plant of da field wuz on earth, n b4 any plant of da field had sprung up, cuz YHWH God hadn't caused it 2 rain on da earth, n there wuz no human bein’ 2 cultivate da ground,
Ge 2:6	but a stream would rise from da earth n water da whole face of da ground--
Ge 2:7	when YHWH God formed da man of dust from da ground, n he blew into his nostrils da breath of lyf, n da man became a livin’ creature. 

Ge 2:8	And YHWH God planted a garden in Eden in da east, n there he put da man whom he had formed.
Ge 2:9	And YHWH God caused 2 grow every tree dat wuz pleasing 2 da sight n gud 4 food. And da tree of lyf wuz in da midst of da garden, along w da tree of da knowledge of gud n bad. 

Ge 2:10	Now a river flowed out from Eden dat watered da garden, n from there it diverged n became 4 branches.
Ge 2:11	Da name of da 1st is da Pishon. It went around all da land of Havilah, where there’s gold.
Ge 2:12	(Da gold of dat land is gud; bdellium n onyx stones r there.)
Ge 2:13	And da name of da 2nd is Gihon. It went around all da land of Cush.
Ge 2:14	And da name of da 3rd is Tigris. It flows east of Assyria. And da 4th river is da Euphrates. 

Ge 2:15	And YHWH God took da man n set him in da garden of Eden 2 cultivate it n 2 keep it.
Ge 2:16	And YHWH God commanded da man, sayin’, "From every tree of da garden u may freely eat,
Ge 2:17	but from da tree of da knowledge of gud n bad u will not eat, 4 in da day dat u eat from it u will ofc die." 

Ge 2:18	Then YHWH God said, "it isn’t gud dat da man is alone. i’ll make 4 him a helper as his counterpart."
Ge 2:19	And out of da ground YHWH God formed every beast of da field n every birb of da sky, n he brought each 2 da man 2 c wut he’d call it. And whatever da man called dat livin’ creature wuz its name.
Ge 2:20	And da man gave names 2 every domesticated animal n 2 da birbs of heaven n 2 all da wild animals. But 4 da man there wasn’t found a helper as his counterpart.
Ge 2:21	And YHWH God caused a deep sleep 2 fall on da man. While he slept, he took 1 of his ribs, n closed up da flesh where it had been.
Ge 2:22	And YHWH God fashioned da rib which he had taken from da man into a woman n brought her 2 da man.
Ge 2:23	And da man said, 
 "She is now bone from my bones n flesh from my flesh; she’ll be called 'Woman,' 4 she wuz taken from man."

Ge 2:24	So a man will leave his dad n his mom n will cling 2 his wife, n they’ll be as 1 flesh.
Ge 2:25	And da man n his wife, both of them, were nude, n they weren't ashamed. 


CHAPTER 3
Ge 3:1	Now da snek wuz more crafty than any other wild animal which YHWH God had made. He said 2 da woman, "Did God indeed say, 'U will not eat from any tree in da garden'?"
Ge 3:2	Da woman said 2 da snek, "From da fruit of da trees of da garden we may eat,
Ge 3:3	but from da tree dat’s in da midst of da garden, God said, 'U will not eat from it, nor will u touch it, lest u die'."
Ge 3:4	But da snek said 2 da woman, "U will not ofc die.
Ge 3:5	Cuz God knows dat on da day u both eat from it, then yo eyes gonna be opened n u both will be like gods, knowing gud n bad."
Ge 3:6	When da woman saw dat da tree wuz gud 4 food n dat 'twas a delight 2 da eyes, n da tree wuz desirable 2 make 1 woke, then she took from its fruit n she ate. And she gave it also 2 her husband w her, n he ate.
Ge 3:7	Then da eyes of both of them were opened, n they knew dat they were nude. And they sewed together fig leaves n they made 4 themselves coverings. 

Ge 3:8	Then they heard da sound of YHWH God walking in da garden at da windy time of day. And da man n his wife hid themselves from da presence of YHWH God among da trees of da garden.
Ge 3:9	And YHWH God called 2 da man n said 2 him, "Where r u?"
Ge 3:10	And he replied, "i heard da sound of u in da garden, n i wuz afraid cuz im nude, so i hid myself."
Ge 3:11	Then he asked, "Who told u dat u were nude? Hav u eaten from da tree from which i forbade u 2 eat?"
Ge 3:12	And da man replied, "Da woman whom u gave 2 be w me--she gave 2 me from da tree n i ate."
Ge 3:13	Then YHWH God said 2 da woman, "Wut is dis u hav done?" And da woman said, "Da snek deceived me, n i ate."
Ge 3:14	Then YHWH God said 2 da snek, 
 "Cuz u hav done dis, u gonna be cursed more than any domesticated animal n more than any wild animal. On yo belly u will go n dust u will eat all da days of yo lyf.
Ge 3:15	And i’ll put hostility between u n between da woman, n between yo offspring n between her offspring; he’ll hit u on da head, n u will hit him on da heel."

Ge 3:16	2 da woman he said, 
 "i’ll greatly increase yo pain in childbearing; in pain u will bear kids. And 2 yo husband will be yo desire. And he’ll rule over u."

Ge 3:17	And 2 Adam he said, "Cuz u listened 2 da voice of yo wife n u ate from da tree from which i forbade u 2 eat, 
 da ground will be cursed on yo account. In pain u will eat from it all da days of yo lyf.
Ge 3:18	And thorns n thistles will sprout 4 u, n u will eat da plants of da field.
Ge 3:19	By da sweat of yo brow u will eat bread, until yo return 2 da ground. Cuz from it u were taken; 4 u r dust, n 2 dust u will return."

Ge 3:20	And da man named his wife Eve, cuz she wuz da mom of all lyf.
Ge 3:21	And YHWH God made 4 Adam n 4 his wife garments of skin, n he clothed them. 

Ge 3:22	And YHWH God said, "Look--da man haz become as 1 of us, 2 kno gud n bad. Wut if he stretches out his hand n takes also from da tree of lyf n eats, n lives 4ever?"
Ge 3:23	And YHWH God sent him out from da garden of Eden, 2 till da ground from which he wuz taken.
Ge 3:24	So he drove da man out, n placed cherubim east of da garden of Eden, n a flaming, turning sword 2 guard da wae 2 da tree of lyf. 


CHAPTER 4
Ge 4:1	Now Adam knew Eve his wife, n she conceived n bore Cain. And she said, "i’ve given birth 2 a man w da help of YHWH."
Ge 4:2	Then she bore his bro Abel. And Abel became a keeper of sheep, n Cain became a tiller of da ground.
Ge 4:3	And in da course of time Cain brought an offering from da fruit of da ground 2 YHWH,
Ge 4:4	n Abel also brought an offering from da choicest firstlings of his flock. And YHWH looked w favor 2 Abel n 2 his offering,
Ge 4:5	but 2 Cain n 2 his offering he didn't look w favor. And Cain became angry af, n his face fell.
Ge 4:6	And YHWH said 2 Cain, "Y r u angry, n y is yo face fallen?
Ge 4:7	If u do well will i not accept u? But if u don’t do well, sin is crouching at da door. And its desire is 4 u, but u must rule over it." 

Ge 4:8	Then Cain said 2 his bro Abel, "Let us go out into da field." And when they were in da field, Cain rose up against his bro Abel n killed him.
Ge 4:9	Then YHWH said 2 Cain, "Where is Abel yo bro?" And he said, "idk; am i my bro's keeper?"
Ge 4:10	And he said, "Wut hav u done? Da voice of yo bro's blood is crying out 2 me from da ground.
Ge 4:11	So now u r cursed from da ground, which haz opened its mouth 2 get da blood of yo bro from yo hand.
Ge 4:12	When u till da ground it’ll no longer yield its strength 2 u. U will be a wanderer n a fugitive on da earth."
Ge 4:13	And Cain said 2 YHWH, "My punishment is better than i can bear.
Ge 4:14	Look, u hav driven me out 2day from da face of da ground, n from yo face i must hide. i gonna be a wanderer n a fugitive on da earth, n it’ll happen dat whoever finds me will kill me."
Ge 4:15	Then YHWH said 2 him, "So, whoever kills Cain gonna be avenged sevenfold." Then YHWH put a sign on Cain so dat whoever found him would not kill him.
Ge 4:16	And Cain went out from da presence of YHWH, n he settled in da land of Nod, east of Eden. 

Ge 4:17	And Cain knew his wife, n she conceived n gave birth 2 Enoch. And when he built a city he named da city after his son, Enoch.
Ge 4:18	And 2 Enoch wuz born Irad, n Irad fathered Mehujael, n Mehujael fathered Methushael, n Methushael fathered Lamech.
Ge 4:19	And Lamech took 2 himself 2 wives. Da name of da 1st wuz Adah, n da name of da 2nd wuz Zillah.
Ge 4:20	And Adah gave birth 2 Jabal; he wuz da dad of those who live in tents n those who hav livestock.
Ge 4:21	And da name of his bro wuz Jubal; he wuz da dad of all who play stringed instruments n wind instruments.
Ge 4:22	Then Zillah also gave birth 2 Tubal-Cain who forged all kinds of tools of bronze n iron. And da sister of Tubal-Cain wuz Naamah. 

Ge 4:23	Then Lamech said 2 his wives, 
 "Adah n Zillah, listen 2 my voice; O wives of Lamech, hear my words. i’ve killed a man 4 wounding me, Even a yung man 4 injuring me.
Ge 4:24	If Cain is avenged sevenfold, Then Lamech gonna be avenged seventy n 7 times.

Ge 4:25	Then Adam knew his wife again, n she gave birth 2 a son. And she called his name Seth, 4 she said "God haz appointed 2 me anotha kid in da place of Abel, cuz Cain killed him."
Ge 4:26	And as 4 Seth, he also fathered a son, n he called his name Enosh. At dat time he began 2 call on da name of YHWH. 


CHAPTER 5
Ge 5:1	Dis is da record of da gens of Adam. When God created Adam, he made him in da likeness of God.
Ge 5:2	Male n female he created them. And he blessed them. And he called their name "Humankind" when they were created.
Ge 5:3	And when Adam had lived 1 hundred n thirty yrs, he fathered a kid in his likeness, accordin’ 2 his image. And he called his name Seth.

Ge 5:10	And after Enosh fathered Kenan he lived 8 hundred n 15 yrs, n fathered sons n daughters.
Ge 5:11	And all da days of Enosh were 9 hundred n 5 yrs, n he died. 

Ge 5:12	When Kenan had lived seventy yrs, he fathered Mahalalel.
Ge 5:13	And after Kenan had fathered Mahalalel, he lived 8 hundred n forty yrs, n fathered sons n daughters.
Ge 5:14	And all da days of Kenan were 9 hundred n 10 yrs, n he died. 

Ge 5:15	When Mahalalel had lived sixty-5 yrs, he fathered Jared.

Ge 5:17	And all da days of Mahalalel were 8 hundred n ninety-5 yrs, n he died.

Ge 5:19	And after Jared had fathered Enoch, he lived 8 hundred yrs, n fathered sons n daughters.
Ge 5:20	And all da days of Jared were 9 hundred n sixty-2 yrs, n he died.

Ge 5:22	And Enoch walked w God after he fathered Methuselah 3 hundred yrs, n fathered sons n daughters.
Ge 5:23	And all da days of Enoch were 3 hundred n sixty-5 yrs.
Ge 5:24	And Enoch walked w God, n he wuz no more, 4 God took him.

Ge 5:27	And all da days of Methuselah were 9 hundred n sixty-9 yrs, n he died.

Ge 5:29	And he called his name Noah, sayin’, "Dis 1 will relieve us from our work, n from da hard labor of our hands, from da ground which YHWH had cursed.
Ge 5:30	And after Lamech had fathered Noah he lived 5 hundred n ninety-5 yrs, n he fathered sons n daughters.
Ge 5:31	All da days of Lamech were 7 hundred n seventy-7 yrs, n he died. 

Ge 5:32	When Noah wuz 5 hundred yrs old, Noah fathered Shem, Ham, n Japheth. 


CHAPTER 6
Ge 6:1	And it happened dat, when humankind began 2 multiply on da face of da ground, daughters were born 2 them.
Ge 6:2	Then da sons of God saw da daughters of humankind, dat they were beautiful. And they took 4 themselves wives from all dat they chose.
Ge 6:3	And YHWH said, "My Spirit will not abide w humankind 4ever in dat he’s also flesh. And his days will be 1 hundred n 20 yrs."
Ge 6:4	Da Nephilim were on da earth in those days, n also afterward, when da sons of God went into da daughters of humankind, n they bore kids 2 them. 

Ge 6:5	And YHWH saw dat da bad of humankind wuz great on da earth, n every inclination of da thoughts of his heart wuz always only bad.
Ge 6:6	And YHWH regretted dat he had made humankind on da earth, n he wuz grieved in his heart.
Ge 6:7	And YHWH said, "i’ll destroy humankind whom i created from on da face of da earth, from humankind, 2 animals, 2 creeping tingz, n 2 da birbs of heaven, cuz i regret dat i’ve made them."
Ge 6:8	But Noah found favor in da eyes of YHWH. 

Ge 6:9	Deez r da gens of Noah. Noah wuz a gud man, without defect in his gens. Noah walked w God.
Ge 6:10	And Noah fathered 3 sons: Shem, Ham, n Japheth.
Ge 6:11	And da earth wuz corrupted b4 God, n da earth wuz filled w violence.
Ge 6:12	And God saw da earth, n look, 'twas corrupt, 4 all flesh had corrupted its wae on da earth.
Ge 6:13	And God said 2 Noah, "Da end of all flesh haz come b4 me, 4 da earth wuz filled w violence cuz of them. Now, look, im goin’ 2 destroy them along w da earth.
Ge 6:14	Make 4 yoself an ark of cypress wood; u must make da ark w rooms, then u must cover it w pitch, inside n outside.
Ge 6:15	And dis is how u must make it: da length of da ark, 3 hundred cubits; its width fifty cubits; its height, thirty cubits.
Ge 6:16	U must make a roof 4 da ark, n finish it 2 a cubit above. And as 4 da door of da ark, u must put it in its side. U must make it w a lower, 2nd, n a 3rd deck. 

Ge 6:17	And i, look, im 'bout 2 bring da flood waters over da earth 2 destroy all flesh in which is da breath of lyf from under da heaven; everythin’ dat’s on da earth will die.
Ge 6:18	And i’ll establish my covenant w u, n u must go into da ark--u, n yo sons, n yo wife, n da wives of yo sons w u.
Ge 6:19	And of every livin’ thang, from all flesh, u must bring 2 from every kind into da ark 2 keep them alive w u; they’ll be male n female.
Ge 6:20	From da birbs accordin’ 2 their kind, n from da animals accordin’ 2 their kind, from every creeping thang on da ground accordin’ 2 its kind--2 from every kind will come 2 u 2 keep them alive.
Ge 6:21	And as 4 u, take 4 yoself from every kind of food dat’s eaten. And u must gather it 2 yoself. And it’ll be 4 u n 4 them 4 food."
Ge 6:22	And Noah did accordin’ 2 all dat God commanded him; so he did. 


CHAPTER 7
Ge 7	
Ge 7:1	Then YHWH said 2 Noah, "Go--u n all yo household--into da ark, cuz i’ve seen u r gud b4 me in dis generation.
Ge 7:2	From all da clean animals u must take 4 yoself 7 pairs, a male n its m8. And from da animals dat aren’t clean u must take 2, a male n its m8,
Ge 7:3	as well as from da birbs of heaven 7 pairs, male n female, 2 keep their kind alive on da face of da earth.
Ge 7:4	Cuz within 7 days i’ll send rain on da earth 4 forty days n forty nights. And i’ll blot out all da livin’ creatures dat i’ve made from on da face of da ground."
Ge 7:5	And Noah did accordin’ 2 all dat YHWH commanded him. 

Ge 7:6	Noah wuz 6 hundred yrs old when da flood waters came on da earth.
Ge 7:7	And Noah n his sons n his wife, n da wives of his sons w him, went into da ark cuz of da waters of da flood.
Ge 7:8	Of clean animals, n of animals which aren’t clean, n of da birbs, n everythin’ dat creeps on da ground,
Ge 7:9	2 of each went 2 Noah, into da ark, male n female, as God had commanded Noah.
Ge 7:10	And it happened dat after 7 days da waters of da flood came over da earth.
Ge 7:11	In da 6 hundredth yr of da lyf of Noah, in da 2nd month, on da 17th day of da month--on dat day all da springs of da great deep were split open, n da windows of heaven were opened.
Ge 7:12	And da rain came on da earth forty days n forty nights.
Ge 7:13	On dis same day, Noah, Shem, Ham, n Japheth, da sons of Noah, n da wife of Noah n da 3 wives of his sons w them, went into da ark,
Ge 7:14	they n all da livin’ creatures accordin’ 2 their kind, n all da domesticated animals accordin’ 2 their kind, n all da creatures dat creep on da earth accordin’ 2 their kind, all da birbs accordin’ 2 their kind, every winged creature.
Ge 7:15	And they came 2 Noah 2 da ark, 2 of each, from every livin’ thang in which wuz da breath of lyf.
Ge 7:16	And those dat came, male n female, of every livin’ thang, came as God had commanded him. And YHWH shut da door behind him.
Ge 7:17	And da flood came forty days n forty nights on da earth. And da waters increased, n lifted da ark, n it rose up from da earth.
Ge 7:18	And da waters prevailed n increased greatly on da earth. And da ark went on da surface of da waters.
Ge 7:19	And da waters prevailed overwhelmingly on da earth, n they covered all da high mountains which were under da entire heaven.
Ge 7:20	Da waters swelled 15 cubits above da mountains, covering them.
Ge 7:21	And every livin’ thang dat moved on da earth died--da birbs, n da domesticated animals, n da wild animals, n everythin’ dat swarmed on da earth, n all humankind.
Ge 7:22	Everythin’ in whose nostrils wuz da breath of lyf, among all dat wuz on dry land, died.
Ge 7:23	And he blotted out every livin’ thang on da surface of da ground, from humankind, 2 animals, 2 creeping tingz, n 2 da birbs of heaven; they were blotted out from da earth. Only Noah n those who were w him in da ark remained.
Ge 7:24	And da waters prevailed over da earth 1 hundred n fifty days. 


CHAPTER 8
Ge 8:1	And God remembered Noah n all da wild animals, n all da domesticated animals dat were w him in da ark. And God caused a wind 2 blow over da earth, n da waters subsided.
Ge 8:2	And da fountains of da deep n da windows of da heavens were closed, n da rain from da heavens wuz restrained.
Ge 8:3	And da waters receded from da earth gradually, n da waters stopped at da end of 1 hundred n fifty days.
Ge 8:4	And da ark came 2 rest in da 7th month, on da 17th day of da month, on da mountains of Ararat.
Ge 8:5	And da waters continued 2 recede 2 da 10th month; in da 10th month, on da 1st of da month, da tops of da mountains appeared.
Ge 8:6	And it happened dat at da end of forty days Noah opened da window of da ark dat he had made.
Ge 8:7	And he sent out a raven; it went 2 n fro until da waters were dried up from on da earth.
Ge 8:8	And he sent out a dove 2 c whether da waters had subsided from on da ground.
Ge 8:9	But da dove didn't find a resting place 4 da sole of her foot, n she returned 2 him into da ark, 4 da waters were still on da face of da earth. And he stretched out his hand n took her, n brought her 2 himself into da ark.
Ge 8:10	And he waited anotha 7 days, n again he sent out da dove from da ark.
Ge 8:11	And da dove came 2 him in da evening, n look, a freshly-picked olive tree leaf wuz in her mouth. And Noah knew dat da waters had subsided from on da earth.
Ge 8:12	And he waited 7 more days, n he sent out da dove. But it didn't return again 2 him.
Ge 8:13	And it happened dat, in da 6 hundred n 1st yr, in da 1st month, on da 1st day of da month, da waters dried up from on da earth. And Noah removed da covering of da ark n looked. And look, da face of da ground wuz dried up.
Ge 8:14	And in da 2nd month, on da 20-7th day of da month, da earth wuz dry.
Ge 8:15	And God spoke 2 Noah, sayin’:
Ge 8:16	"Go out from da ark, u n yo wife, n yo sons, n yo sons' wives w u.
Ge 8:17	Bring out w u all da livin’ tingz which r w u, from all da livin’ creatures--birbs, n animals, n everythin’ dat creeps on da earth, n let them swarm on da earth n be fruitful n multiply on da earth."
Ge 8:18	So Noah went out, w his sons n his wife, n da wives of his sons w him.
Ge 8:19	Every animal, every creeping thang, n every birb, n everythin’ dat moves on da earth, accordin’ 2 its fams, went out from da ark.
Ge 8:20	And Noah built an altar 2 YHWH, n he took from all da clean animals n from all da clean birbs, n offered burnt offerings on da altar.
Ge 8:21	And YHWH smelled da soothing fragrance, n YHWH said 2 himself, "Never again will i curse da ground 4 da sake of humankind, cuz da inclination of da heart of humankind is bad from his youth. Nor will i ever again destroy all lyf as i’ve done.
Ge 8:22	As long as da earth endures, seed n harvest, cold n heat, summer n winter, day n night won’t cease. 


CHAPTER 9
Ge 9:1	And God blessed Noah n his sons, n said 2 them, "Be fruitful n multiply, n fill da earth.
Ge 9:2	And fear of u n dread of u will be on every animal of da earth, n on every birb of heaven, n on everythin’ dat moves on da ground, n on all da fish of da sea. Into yo hand they’ll be given.
Ge 9:3	Every moving thang dat lives will be 4 u as food. As i gave da green plants 2 u, i’ve now given u everythin’.
Ge 9:4	Only u will not eat raw flesh w blood in it.
Ge 9:5	And yo lifeblood i’ll require; from every animal i’ll require it. And from da hand of humankind, from da hand of each man 2 his bro i’ll require da lyf of humankind. 

Ge 9:6	"As 4 da 1 shedding da blood of humankind, by humankind his blood will be shed, 4 God made humankind in his own image.

Ge 9:7	"And u, be fruitful n multiply, swarm on da earth n multiply in it."
Ge 9:8	And God said 2 Noah n 2 his sons w him,
Ge 9:9	"As 4 me, look, im establishing my covenant w u n w yo seed after u,
Ge 9:10	n w every livin’ creature dat’s w u--da birbs, da animals, n every animal of da earth w u, from all dat came out of da ark 2 all da animals of da earth.
Ge 9:11	im establishing my covenant w u, dat never again will all flesh be cut off by da waters of a flood, nor will there ever be a flood dat destroys da earth."
Ge 9:12	And God said, "Dis is da sign of da covenant dat im making between me n u, n between every livin’ creature dat’s w u 4 future gens.
Ge 9:13	My bow i’ve set in da clouds, n it’ll be 4 a sign of da covenant between me n between da earth.
Ge 9:14	And when i make clouds appear over da earth da bow will be seen in da clouds.
Ge 9:15	Then i’ll remember my covenant dat’s between me n u, n between every livin’ creature, w all flesh. And da waters of a flood will never again cause da destruction of all flesh.
Ge 9:16	Da bow will be in da clouds, n i’ll c it, so as 2 remember da everlasting covenant between God n between every livin’ creature, w all flesh dat’s on da earth."
Ge 9:17	And God said 2 Noah, "Dis is da sign of da covenant which im establishing between me n all flesh dat’s on da earth. 

Ge 9:18	Now da sons of Noah who came out of da ark were Shem, Ham, n Japheth. (Ham wuz da dad of Canaan.)
Ge 9:19	Deez 3 were da sons of Noah, n from deez da whole earth wuz populated.
Ge 9:20	And Noah began 2 be a man of da ground, n he planted a vineyard.
Ge 9:21	And he drank some of da wine n became drunk, n he exposed himself in da midst of his tent.
Ge 9:22	And Ham, da dad of Canaan, saw da nakedness of his dad, n he told his 2 bros outside.
Ge 9:23	Then Shem n Japheth took a garment, n da 2 of them put it on their shoulders n, walking backward, they covered da nakedness of their dad. And their faces were turned backward, so dat they didn't c da nakedness of their dad.
Ge 9:24	Then Noah awoke from his drunkenness, n he knew wut his youngest son had done 2 him.
Ge 9:25	And he said, 
 "Cursed be Canaan, a slave of slaves he’ll be 2 his bros."

Ge 9:26	Then he said, 
 "Blessed be YHWH, da God of Shem, n let Canaan be a slave 2 them.
Ge 9:27	May God make space 4 Japheth, n let him dwell in da tents of Shem, n let Canaan be a slave 4 him."

Ge 9:28	And Noah lived 3 hundred n fifty yrs after da flood.
Ge 9:29	And all da days of Noah were 9 hundred n fifty yrs, n he died. 


CHAPTER 10
Ge 10:1	Deez r da gens of da sons of Noah--Shem, Ham, n Japheth. Kids were born 2 them after da flood.

Ge 10:8	And Cush fathered Nimrod. He wuz da 1st on earth 2 be a mighty warrior.
Ge 10:9	He wuz a mighty hunter b4 YHWH. So 'twas said, "Like Nimrod a mighty hunter b4 YHWH."
Ge 10:10	Now, da beginning of his kingdom wuz Babel, Erech, Akkad, n Calneh, in da land of Shinar.
Ge 10:11	From dat land he went out 2 Assyria, n he built Nineveh, Rehoboth-Ir, Calah,
Ge 10:12	Resen between Nineveh n Calah; dat’s da great city.
Ge 10:13	And Egypt fathered Ludim, Anamim, Lehabim, Naphtuhim,
Ge 10:14	Pathrusim, n Casluhim (from whom da Philistines came), n Caphtorim. 

Ge 10:15	Canaan fathered Sidon, his firstborn, n Heth,

Ge 10:17	da Hivites, da Arkites, da Sinites,
Ge 10:18	da Arvadites, da Zemarites, n da Hamathites. Afterward da fams of da Canaanites were spread abroad.
Ge 10:19	And da territory of da Canaanites wuz from Sidon in da direction of Gerar as far as Gaza, n in da direction of Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, n Zeboiim, as far as Lasha.
Ge 10:20	Deez r da descendants of Ham, accordin’ 2 their fams n their languages, in their lands, n in their nations.

Ge 10:32	Deez r da fams of da sons of Noah, accordin’ 2 their gens n in their nations. And from deez da nations spread abroad on da earth after da flood. 


CHAPTER 11
Ge 11:1	Now da whole earth had 1 language n da same words.
Ge 11:2	And as ppl migrated from da east they found a plain in da land of Shinar n settled there.
Ge 11:3	And they said 2 each other, "Come, let’s make bricks n burn them thoroughly." And they had brick 4 stone n they had tar 4 mortar.
Ge 11:4	And they said, "Come, let’s build ourselves a city n a tower whose top reaches 2 da heavens. And let’s make a name 4 ourselves, lest we be scattered over da face of da whole earth." 

Ge 11:5	Then YHWH came down 2 c da city n da tower dat humankind wuz building.
Ge 11:6	And YHWH said, "Look, they’re 1 ppl w 1 language, n dis is only da beginning of wut they’ll do. So now nothin’ dat they intend 2 do gonna be impossible 4 them.
Ge 11:7	Come, let’s go down n confuzzle their language there, so dat they’ll not understand each other's language."
Ge 11:8	So YHWH scattered them from there over da face of da whole earth, n they stopped building da city.
Ge 11:9	So its name wuz called Babel, 4 there YHWH confuzzled da language of da whole earth, n there YHWH scattered them over da face of da whole earth. 

Ge 11:10	Deez r da gens of Shem. When Shem wuz 1 hundred yrs old, he fathered Arphaxad, 2 yrs after da flood.
Ge 11:11	And Shem lived 5 hundred yrs after he fathered Arphaxad, n he fathered other sons n daughters.
Ge 11:12	When Arphaxad had lived thirty-5 yrs, he fathered Shelah.
Ge 11:13	And Arphaxad lived 4 hundred n 3 yrs after he fathered Shelah, n he fathered other sons n daughters.
Ge 11:14	When Shelah had lived thirty yrs, he fathered Eber.
Ge 11:15	And Shelah lived 4 hundred n 3 yrs after he fathered Eber, n he fathered other sons n daughters.

Ge 11:32	And da days of Terah were 2 hundred n 5 yrs, n Terah died in Haran. 


CHAPTER 12
Ge 12:1	And YHWH said 2 Abram, "Go out from yo land n from yo relatives, n from da house of yo dad, 2 da land dat i’ll show u.
Ge 12:2	And i’ll make u a great nation, n i’ll bless u, n i’ll make yo name great. And u gonna be a blessing.
Ge 12:3	And i’ll bless those who bless u, n those who curse u i’ll curse. And all fams of da earth gonna be blessed in u." 

Ge 12:4	And Abram went out as YHWH had told him, n Lot went w him. Now Abram wuz seventy-5 yrs old when he went out from Haran.
Ge 12:5	And Abram took Sarai his wife, n Lot his nephew, n all their possessions dat they had gathered, n all da persons dat they had acquired in Haran, n they went out 2 go 2 da land of Canaan. And they went 2 da land of Canaan.
Ge 12:6	And Abram traveled thru da land up 2 da place of Shechem, 2 da Oak of Moreh. Now da Canaanites were in da land at dat time.
Ge 12:7	And YHWH appeared 2 Abram n said, "2 yo offspring i’ll give dis land." And he built an altar there 2 YHWH, who had appeared 2 him.
Ge 12:8	And he moved on from there 2 da hill country, east of Bethel. And he pitched his tent at Bethel on da west, n at Ai on da east. And he built an altar there 2 YHWH. And he called on da name of YHWH.
Ge 12:9	And Abram kept moving on, toward da Negev.
Ge 12:10	And there wuz a famine in da land. And Abram went down 2 Egypt 2 dwell as an alien there, 4 da famine wuz severe in da land.
Ge 12:11	And it happened dat as he drew near 2 enter into Egypt, he said 2 Sarai his wife, "Look now, i kno dat u r a woman beautiful of appearance,
Ge 12:12	n it’ll happen dat, if da Egyptians c u, then they’ll say, 'Dis is his wife,' then they’ll kill me but let u live.
Ge 12:13	Please say u r my sister so dat it’ll go well 4 me on yo account. Then i’ll live on account of u."
Ge 12:14	And it happened dat as Abram came into Egypt, da Egyptians saw da woman, dat she wuz beautiful af.
Ge 12:15	And da officials of Pharaoh saw her, n they praised her beauty 2 Pharaoh. And da woman wuz taken 2 da house of Pharaoh.
Ge 12:16	And he dealt well w Abram on account of her, n he had sheep, cattle, male donkeys, male servants, female servants, female donkeys, n camels.
Ge 12:17	Then YHWH afflicted Pharaoh n his household w severe plagues on account of da matter of Sarai da wife of Abram.
Ge 12:18	Then Pharaoh called 4 Abram n said, "Wut is dis u hav done 2 me? Y did u not tell me dat she wuz yo wife?
Ge 12:19	Y did u say 'She is my sister,' so dat i took her 2 myself as a wife? Now then, here is yo wife. Take her n go."
Ge 12:20	And Pharaoh commanded his men abt him, n then sent him n his wife n all dat wuz w him away. 


CHAPTER 13
Ge 13:1	Then Abram went up from Egypt, he n his wife n all dat wuz w him. And Lot went w him 2 da Negev.
Ge 13:2	Now Abram wuz wealthy af in livestock, in silver, n in gold.
Ge 13:3	And he went accordin’ 2 his journey from da Negev, then 2 Bethel, 2 da place where his tent wuz at da beginning, between Bethel n Ai,
Ge 13:4	2 da place where he had made an altar at da beginning. And Abram called on da name of YHWH there.
Ge 13:5	And Lot, who went w Abram, also had herds n tents.
Ge 13:6	And da land couldn't support them so as 2 live together, cuz their possessions were so many dat they weren't able 2 live together.
Ge 13:7	And there wuz a quarrel between da herdsmen of da livestock of Abram n da herdsmen of da livestock of Lot. Now at dat time da Canaanites n da Perizzites were livin’ in da land.
Ge 13:8	Then Abram said 2 Lot, "Please, let there not be quarreling between me n u, n between my shepherds n yo shepherds, 4 we men r bros.
Ge 13:9	Is not da whole land b4 u? Separate yoself from me. If u want wut is on da left, then i’ll go right; if u want wut is on da right, i’ll go left."
Ge 13:10	And Lot lifted up his eyes n saw da whole plain of da Jordan, dat all of 'twas well-watered land--dis wuz b4 YHWH destroyed Sodom n Gomorrah--like da garden of YHWH, like da land of Egypt in da direction of Zoar.
Ge 13:11	So Lot chose 4 himself all da plain of da Jordan. And Lot journeyed from da east, n so they separated from each other.
Ge 13:12	Abram settled in da land of Canaan, n Lot settled in da cities of da plain. And he pitched his tent toward Sodom.
Ge 13:13	Now da men of Sodom were extremely wicked sinners against YHWH.
Ge 13:14	And YHWH said 2 Abram after Lot had separated from him, "Now, lift up yo eyes n look from da place where u r 2 da north, n 2 da south, n 2 da east n 2 da west,
Ge 13:15	4 all da land which u c i’ll give 2 u, n 2 yo descendants, 4ever.
Ge 13:16	i’ll make yo descendants like da dust of da earth which, if anyone were able 2 count da dust of da earth, yo descendants would be so counted.
Ge 13:17	Arise, go thru da length of da land n thru its breadth, cuz i’ll give it 2 u."
Ge 13:18	So Abram pitched his tent, n he came n settled at da oaks of Mamre, which were at Hebron. And there he built an altar 2 YHWH. 


CHAPTER 14
Ge 14:1	And it happened dat in da days of Amraphel, da king of Shinar, Arioch, da king of Ellasar, Kedorlaomer, da king of Elam, n Tidal, da king of Goiim,
Ge 14:2	made war w Bera, da king of Sodom, n Birsha, da king of Gomorrah, Shinab, da king of Admah, n Shemeber, da king of Zeboiim, n da king of Bela (dat’s, Zoar).
Ge 14:3	All deez joined forces at da valley of Siddim (dat’s, da sea of da salt).
Ge 14:4	12 yrs they had served Kedorlaomer, but in da 13th yr they rebelled.
Ge 14:5	In da 14th yr Kedorlaomer n da kings who were w him came n rekt da Rephaim in Ashteroth-Karnaim, n da Zuzim in Ham, n da Emim in Shaveh-Kiriathaim,
Ge 14:6	And da Horites in their hill country of Seir, as far as El-Paran, which is at da wilderness.
Ge 14:7	Then they turned back n came 2 En-Mishpat (dat’s, Kadesh). And they rekt da whole territory of da Amalekites, n also da Amorites who were livin’ in Hazazon-Tamar.
Ge 14:8	Then da king of Sodom, da king of Gomorrah, da king of Admah, da king of Zeboiim, n da king of Bela (dat’s, Zoar) went out, n they took up battle position in da Valley of Siddim
Ge 14:9	w Kedorlaomer, king of Elam, n Tidal, king of Goiim, n Amraphel, king of Shinar, n Arioch, king of Ellasar, 4 kings against 5.
Ge 14:10	Now da Valley of Siddim wuz full of tar pits. And da kings of Sodom n Gomorrah fled n fell into them, but da rest fled 2 da mountains.
Ge 14:11	So they took all da possessions of Sodom n Gomorrah n all their provisions, n they left.
Ge 14:12	And they took Lot, da son of da bro of Abram, n his possessions, n left. (Now he had been livin’ in Sodom.)
Ge 14:13	Then 1 who escaped came n told Abram da Hebrew. And he wuz livin’ at da oaks of Mamre da Amorite, bro of Eshcol n bro of Aner. They were allies w Abram.
Ge 14:14	When Abram heard dat his relative wuz taken captive, he summoned his trained men, born in his house, 3 hundred n 18 of them, n he went in pursuit up 2 Dan.
Ge 14:15	And he divided his trained men against them at night, he n his servants. And he rekt them n pursued them 2 Hobah, which is north of Damascus.
Ge 14:16	And he brought back all da possessions. And he also brought back Lot, his relative, n his possessions, n da women n da ppl as well. 

Ge 14:17	After his return from defeating Kedorlaomer n da kings who were w him, da king of Sodom went out 2 meet him at da Valley of Shaveh (dat’s, da Valley of da King).
Ge 14:18	And Melchizedek, da king of Salem, brought out bread n wine. (He wuz da priest of God Most High).
Ge 14:19	And he blessed him n said, 
 "Blessed be Abram by God Most High, Maker of heaven n earth.
Ge 14:20	And blessed be God Most High who delivered yo enemies into yo hand."
 And he gave 2 him a 10th of everythin’.
Ge 14:21	And da king of Sodom said 2 Abram, "Give me da ppl, but da possessions take 4 yoself."
Ge 14:22	And Abram said 2 da king of Sodom, "i’ve raised my hand 2 YHWH, God Most High, Maker of heaven n earth,
Ge 14:23	dat neither a thread nor a thong of a sandal would i take from all dat belongs 2 u, dat u might not say, 'i made Abram rich.'
Ge 14:24	Nothin’ besides wut da servants hav eaten n da share of da men who went out w me will i take. Let Aner, Eshcol, n Mamre take their share." 


CHAPTER 15
Ge 15:1	After deez tingz da word of YHWH came 2 Abram in a vision, sayin’: "Don’t be afraid, Abram; im yo shield, n yo reward will be great af."
Ge 15:2	Then Abram said, "O YHWH, my Lord, wut will u gimme? i continue 2 be without kids, n my heir is Eliezer of Damascus."
Ge 15:3	And Abram said, "Look, u haven't given me a descendant, n here, a member of my household is my heir."
Ge 15:4	And look, da word of YHWH came 2 him sayin’, "Dis person won’t be yo heir, but yo own son gonna be yo heir."
Ge 15:5	And he brought him outside n said, "Look toward da heavens n count da stars if u r able 2 count them." And he said 2 him, "So will yo offspring be."
Ge 15:6	And he believed in YHWH, n he reckoned it 2 him as righteousness.
Ge 15:7	And he said 2 him, "im YHWH, who brought u out from Ur of da Chaldeans 2 give dis land 2 u, 2 possess it."
Ge 15:8	And he said, "O YHWH God, how will i kno dat i’ll possess it?"
Ge 15:9	And he said 2 him, "Take 4 me a 3-yr-old heifer, n a 3-yr-old female goat, n a 3-yr-old ram, n a turtledove n a yung pigeon."
Ge 15:10	And he took 4 him all deez n cut them in pieces down da middle. And he put each piece opposite da other, but da birbs he didn't cut.
Ge 15:11	And da birbs of prey came down on da carcasses, but Abram drove them away.
Ge 15:12	And it happened, as da sun went down, then a deep sleep fell on Abram n, look, a great terrifying darkness fell on him.
Ge 15:13	And he said 2 Abram, "U must ofc kno dat yo descendants will be as aliens in a land not their own. And they’ll serve them n they’ll oppress them 4 hundred yrs.
Ge 15:14	And also da nation dat they serve i’ll judge. Then afterward they’ll go out w great possessions.
Ge 15:15	And as 4 u, u will go 2 yo ancestors in pce; u will be buried in a gud old age.
Ge 15:16	And da 4th generation will return here, 4 da guilt of da Amorites isn’t yet complete."
Ge 15:17	And after da sun had gone down n 'twas dusk, look, a smoking firepot n a flaming torch passed between those half pieces.
Ge 15:18	On dat day YHWH made a covenant w Abram sayin’, "2 yo offspring i’ll give dis land, from da river of Egypt 2 da great river, da Euphrates river,
Ge 15:19	da land of da Kenites, da Kenizzites, da Kadmonites,
Ge 15:20	da Hittites, da Perizzites, da Rephaim,
Ge 15:21	da Amorites, da Canaanites, da Girgashites, n da Jebusites." 


CHAPTER 16
Ge 16:1	Now Sarai, da wife of Abram, had borne him no kids. And she had a female Egyptian servant, n her name wuz Hagar.
Ge 16:2	And Sarai said 2 Abram, "Look, please, YHWH haz prevented me from bearing kids. Please go in 2 my servant; maybe i’ll hav kids by her." And Abram listened 2 da voice of Sarai.
Ge 16:3	Then Sarai, da wife of Abram, took Hagar, her Egyptian servant, after Abram had lived 10 yrs in da land of Canaan, n gave her 2 Abram her husband as his wife.
Ge 16:4	And he went in 2 Hagar, n she conceived. And when she saw dat she had conceived, then her mistress grew smol in her eyes.
Ge 16:5	And Sarai said 2 Abram, "may my harm be on u. i had my servant sleep w u, n when she saw dat she had conceived, she no longer respeckted me. May YHWH judge between me n u!"
Ge 16:6	And Abram said 2 Sarai, "Look, yo servant is under yo authority. Do 2 her dat which is gud in yo eyes." And Sarai mistreated her, n she fled from her presence. 

Ge 16:7	And da angel of YHWH found her at a spring of water in da wilderness, at da spring by da road of Shur.
Ge 16:8	And he said 2 Hagar, da servant of Sarai, "From where hav u come, n where r u goin’?" And she said, "im fleeing from da presence of Sarai my mistress."
Ge 16:9	Then da angel of YHWH said 2 her, "Return 2 yo mistress n submit yoself under her authority."
Ge 16:10	And da angel of YHWH said 2 her, "i’ll greatly multiply yo offspring, so dat they can’t be counted 4 their abundance."
Ge 16:11	And da angel of YHWH said 2 her: 
 "Look, u r preggers n will hav a son. And u will call his name Ishmael, 4 YHWH haz listened 2 yo suffering.
Ge 16:12	And he’ll be a wild donkey of a man, his hand gonna be against e’erybody, n da hand of e’erybody gonna be against him, n he’ll live in hostility w all his bros."

Ge 16:13	So she called da name of YHWH who spoke 2 her, "U r El-Roi," 4 she said, "Here i’ve seen after he who sees me."
Ge 16:14	So da well wuz called Beer-Lahai-Roi; look, it’s between Kadesh n Bered.
Ge 16:15	And Hagar had a kid 4 Abram, a son. And Abram called da name of his son whom Hagar bore 2 him, Ishmael.
Ge 16:16	And Abram wuz eighty-6 yrs old when Hagar bore Ishmael 2 Abram. 


CHAPTER 17
Ge 17:1	When Abram wuz 99 yrs old YHWH appeared 2 Abram. And he said 2 him, "im El-Shaddai; walk b4 me n be blameless
Ge 17:2	so dat i may make my covenant between me n u, n may multiply u exceedingly."
Ge 17:3	Then Abram fell on his face n God spoke w him, sayin’,
Ge 17:4	"As 4 me, look, my covenant will be w u, n u will be da dad of a multitude of nations.
Ge 17:5	Yo name will no longer be called Abram, but yo name will be Abe, cuz i’ll make u da dad of a multitude of nations.
Ge 17:6	And i’ll make u exceedingly fruitful. i’ll make u a nation, n kings will go out from u.
Ge 17:7	And i’ll establish my covenant between me n u, n between yo offspring after u, throughout their gens as an everlasting covenant 2 be as God 4 u n 2 yo offspring after u.
Ge 17:8	And i’ll give 2 u n 2 yo offspring after u da land in which u r livin’ as an alien, all da land of Canaan, as an everlasting property. And i gonna be 2 them as God." 

Ge 17:9	And God said 2 Abe, "Now as 4 u, u must keep my covenant, u n yo offspring after u, throughout their gens.
Ge 17:10	Dis is my covenant which u will keep, between me n u, n also w yo offspring after u: Every male among u will be cut.
Ge 17:11	And u will cut da flesh of yo foreskin, n it’ll be a sign of da covenant between me n u.
Ge 17:12	And at 8 days of age u will yoselves cut every male belonging 2 yo gens n da servant born in yo house n da 1 bought from any foreigner who isn’t from yo offspring.
Ge 17:13	U must totally cut da servant born in yo house n da 1 bought from any foreigner. And my covenant will be w yo flesh as an everlasting covenant.
Ge 17:14	And as 4 any uncircumcised male who hasn't cut da flesh of his foreskin, dat person will be cut off from his ppl. He haz broken my covenant.
Ge 17:15	And God said 2 Abe, "as 4 Sarai yo wife, u will not call her name Sarai, 4 Sarah will be her name.
Ge 17:16	And i’ll bless her; moreover, i give 2 u from her a son. And i’ll bless her, n she’ll give rise 2 nations. Kings of peoples will come from her."
Ge 17:17	And Abe fell on his face n LOLed. And he said in his heart, "Can a kid be born 2 a man a hundred yrs old, or can Sarah bear a kid at ninety?"
Ge 17:18	And Abe said 2 God, "Oh dat Ishmael might live b4 u!"
Ge 17:19	And God said, "No, but Sarah yo wife will bear a son 4 u, n u will call his name Isaac. And i’ll establish my covenant w him as an everlasting covenant 2 his offspring after him.
Ge 17:20	And as 4 Ishmael, i’ve heard u. Look, i’ll bless him n i’ll make him fruitful, n i’ll multiply him exceedingly. He will dad 12 princes, n i’ll make him a great nation.
Ge 17:21	But my covenant i’ll establish w Isaac, whom Sarah will bear 2 u at dis appointed time next yr."
Ge 17:22	When he finished talkin’ w him, God went up from Abe.
Ge 17:23	And Abe took Ishmael his son n all who were born of his house, n all those acquired by his money, every male among da men of Abe's house, n he cut da flesh of their foreskin on da same day dat God spoke w him.
Ge 17:24	Abe wuz 99 yrs old when he cut da flesh of his foreskin.
Ge 17:25	And Ishmael his son wuz 13 yrs old when he cut da flesh of his foreskin.
Ge 17:26	Abe n his son Ishmael were cut on da same day.
Ge 17:27	And all da men of his house, those born in da house, n those acquired by money from a foreigner, were cut w him. 


CHAPTER 18
Ge 18:1	And YHWH appeared 2 him by da oaks of Mamre. And he wuz sitting in da doorway of da tent at da heat of da day.
Ge 18:2	And he lifted up his eyes n saw, n look, 3 men were standing near him. And he saw them n ran from da doorway of da tent 2 meet them. And he bowed down 2 da ground.
Ge 18:3	And he said, "My lord, if i’ve found favor in yo eyes don’t pass by yo servant.
Ge 18:4	Let a lil’ water be brought n wash yo feet, n rest under da tree.
Ge 18:5	And let me bring a piece of bread, then refresh yoselves. Afterward u can pass on, once u hav passed by w yo servant." Then they said, "Do so as u hav said."
Ge 18:6	Then Abe hastened into da tent 2 Sarah, n he said, "Quickly--make 3 seahs of fine flour 4 kneading n make bread cakes!"
Ge 18:7	And Abe ran 2 da cattle n took a calf, tender n gud, n gave it 2 da servant, n he made haste 2 prepare it.
Ge 18:8	Then he took curds n milk, n da calf which he prepared, n set it b4 them. And he wuz standing by them under da tree while they ate.
Ge 18:9	And they said 2 him, "Where is Sarah yo wife?" And he said, "Here, in da tent."
Ge 18:10	And he said, "i’ll totally return 2 u in da spring, n look, Sarah yo wife will hav a son." Now Sarah wuz listening at da doorway of da tent, n which wuz behind him.
Ge 18:11	Now Abe n Sarah were old, advanced in age; da wey of women had ceased 2 be 4 Sarah.
Ge 18:12	So Sarah LOLed 2 herself sayin’, "After im worn out n my husband is old, will dis pleasure be 2 me?"
Ge 18:13	Then YHWH said 2 Abe, "Wut is dis dat Sarah LOLed, sayin’, 'Is it indeed tru dat i’ll bear a kid, now dat i’ve grown old?'
Ge 18:14	Is anythin’ too difficult 4 YHWH? At da appointed time i’ll return 2 u in da spring n Sarah will hav a son."
Ge 18:15	But Sarah denied it, sayin’, "i didn't laugh," cuz she wuz afraid. He said, "No, but u did laugh." 

Ge 18:16	Then da men set out from there, n they looked down on Sodom. And Abe went w them 2 send them on their wae.
Ge 18:17	Then YHWH said, "Will i conceal from Abe wut im goin’ 2 do?
Ge 18:18	Abe will ofc become a great n strong nation, n all da nations of da earth gonna be blessed on account of him.
Ge 18:19	Cuz i’ve chosen him, dat he’ll command his kids n his household after him dat they’ll keep da wey of YHWH, 2 do righteousness n justice, so dat YHWH may bring on Abe dat which he said 2 him."
Ge 18:20	Then YHWH said, "Cuz da outcry of Sodom n Gomorrah is great n cuz their sin is srs af,
Ge 18:21	i’ll go down n i’ll c. Hav they done altogether accordin’ 2 its cri of distress which haz come 2 me? If not, i’ll kno." 

Ge 18:22	And da men turned from there n went toward Sodom. And Abe wuz still standing b4 YHWH.
Ge 18:23	And Abe drew near 2 YHWH n said, "Will u also sweep away da gud w da wicked?
Ge 18:24	If maybe there r fifty gud in da midst of da city, will u also sweep them away n not forgive da place on account of da fifty gud in her midst?
Ge 18:25	Far be it from u 2 do such a thang as dis, 2 kill da gud w da wicked, dat da gud would be as da wicked! Far be it from u! Will not da Judge of all da earth do justice?"
Ge 18:26	And YHWH said, "If i find fifty gud in Sodom, in da midst of da city, then i’ll forgive da whole place 4 their sake."
Ge 18:27	Then Abe answered n said, "Look, please, i wuz bold 2 talk 2 my Lord, but im dust n ashes.
Ge 18:28	Maybe da fifty gud r lacking 5--will u destroy da whole city on account of da 5?" And he answered, "i’ll not destroy it if i find forty-5 there."
Ge 18:29	And once again he spoke 2 him n said, "Wut if forty r found there?" And he answered, "i’ll not do it on account of da forty."
Ge 18:30	And he said, "Please, let not my Lord be angry, n i’ll talk. Wut if thirty be found there?" And he answered, "i’ll not do it if i find thirty there."
Ge 18:31	And he said, "Please, now, i wuz bold 2 talk 2 my Lord. Wut if 20 be found there?" And he answered, "i’ll not destroy it 4 da sake of da 20."
Ge 18:32	And he said, "Please, let not my Lord be angry, n i’ll talk only once more. Wut if 10 r found there?" And he answered, "i’ll not destroy it 4 da sake of da 10."
Ge 18:33	Then YHWH left, as he finished talkin’ 2 Abe, n Abe returned 2 his place. 


CHAPTER 19
Ge 19:1	And da 2 angels came 2 Sodom in da evening. And Lot wuz sitting in da gateway of Sodom. Then Lot saw them n stood up 2 meet them. And he bowed down w his face 2 da ground.
Ge 19:2	And he said, "Look, my lords, please turn aside into da house of yo servant n spend da night n wash yo feet. Then u can rise early n go on yo wae." And they said, "No, but we'll spend da night in da square."
Ge 19:3	But he urged them strongly, n they turned aside w him n came into his house. And he made a meal 4 them n baked unleavened bread, n they ate.
Ge 19:4	B4 they laid down, da men of da city, da men of Sodom, both yung n old, all da ppl 2 da last man, surrounded da house.
Ge 19:5	And they called 2 Lot n said 2 him, "Where r da men who came 2 u tonight? Bring them out 2 us so dat we may kno them."
Ge 19:6	But Lot went out 2 them at da entrance, n he shut da door behind him.
Ge 19:7	And he said, "No, my bros, please don’t do such a wrong thang.
Ge 19:8	Look, i’ve 2 daughters who haven't known a man. Please, let me bring them out 2 u; then do 2 them as it seems gud in yo eyes. Only 2 deez men don’t do dis thang, since they came under my roof 4 protection."
Ge 19:9	But they said, "Step aside!" Then they said, "Dis fellow came 2 dwell as a foreigner n he acts as a judge! Now we will do worse 2 u than them!" And they pressed very hard against da man, against Lot, n they drew near 2 break da door.
Ge 19:10	Then da men reached out w their hands n brought Lot in 2 them, into da house, n they shut da door.
Ge 19:11	And da men who were at da entrance of da house they struck w blindness, both smol n great, n they were unable 2 find da entrance.
Ge 19:12	Then da men said 2 Lot, "Who is here w u? Bring out from da place yo sons-in-law, n yo sons n yo daughters, n all who r w u in da city.
Ge 19:13	Cuz we're 'bout 2 destroy dis place, cuz their cri haz become great b4 YHWH. YHWH sent us 2 destroy it."
Ge 19:14	Then Lot went out n spoke 2 his sons-in-law who were taking his daughters n said, "Get up! Go out from dis place, cuz YHWH is goin’ 2 destroy da city!" But it seemed like a joke in da eyes of his sons-in-law.
Ge 19:15	And as da dawn came up da angels urged Lot sayin’, "Get up, take yo wife n yo 2 daughters who r stayin’ w u, lest u be destroyed w da punishment of da city."
Ge 19:16	But when he lingered, da men seized him by his hand n his wife's hand, n his 2 daughters by hand, on account of da mercy of YHWH on him. And they brought him out n set him outside of da city.
Ge 19:17	And after bringing them outside 1 said, "Flee 4 yo lyf; don’t look behind u, n don’t stand anywhere in da plain. Flee 2 da mountains lest u be destroyed."
Ge 19:18	And Lot said 2 them, "No, please, my lords.
Ge 19:19	Look, yo servant haz found favor in yo eyes n u hav shown me great kindness in saving my lyf. But i can’t flee 2 da mountains, lest da disaster overtake me n i die.
Ge 19:20	Look, dis city is near enough 2 flee there, n it’s a lil’ 1. Please, let me flee there. Is it not a lil’ 1? Then my lyf will be saved."
Ge 19:21	And he said 2 him, "Look, i’ll grant dis favor as well; dat i’ll not overthrow da city of which u hav spoken.
Ge 19:22	Escape there quickly, cuz i can’t do dis thang until u get there." So, there name of da city wuz called Zoar. 

Ge 19:23	After da sun had risen on da earth n Lot had entered Zoar,
Ge 19:24	YHWH rained down from heaven on Sodom n Gomorrah brimstone n fire from YHWH.
Ge 19:25	And he overthrew those cities n da whole plain, n da ppl of da cities n da vegetation of da ground.
Ge 19:26	But his wife looked back, n she became a pillar of salt.
Ge 19:27	And Abe arose early in da mornin’ n went 2 da place where he had stood b4 YHWH.
Ge 19:28	And he looked down on da surface of Sodom n Gomorrah, n on da whole surface of da land, da plain. And he saw dat, look, da smoke of da land went up like da smoke of a smelting furnace.
Ge 19:29	So 'twas, when God destroyed da cities of da plain dat God remembered Abe n sent Lot out from da midst of da overthrow, when he overthrew da cities in which Lot lived. 

Ge 19:30	And Lot went out from Zoar n settled in da hill country w his 2 daughters, 4 he wuz afraid 2 stay in Zoar. So he lived in a cave, he n his 2 daughters.
Ge 19:31	And da firstborn daughter said 2 da younger 1, "Our dad is old, n there’s no man in da land 2 come in 2 us accordin’ 2 da manner of all da land.
Ge 19:32	Come, let’s give our dad wine 2 drink n let’s lie w him dat we may secure descendants thru our dad."
Ge 19:33	And they gave their dad wine 2 drink dat night, n da firstborn went n lay w her dad, but he didn't kno when she lay down or when she got up.
Ge 19:34	And it happened dat, da next day da firstborn said 2 da younger 1, "Look, i laid w my dad last night. Let us give him wine 2 drink also tonight, then go n lie w him dat we may secure descendants thru our dad."
Ge 19:35	And they gave their dad wine 2 drink again dat night, n da younger got up n lay w him, but he didn't kno when she lay down or when she got up.
Ge 19:36	And da 2 daughters of Lot became preggers by their dad.
Ge 19:37	Da firstborn gave birth 2 a son, n she called his name Moab. He is da dad of Moab until dis day.
Ge 19:38	And da younger, she also gave birth 2 a son, n she called his name Ben-Ammi. He is da dad of da Ammonites until dis day. 


CHAPTER 20
Ge 20:1	And Abe journeyed from there 2 da land of da Negev, n he settled between Kadesh n Shur. And he dwelled as an alien in Gerar.
Ge 20:2	And Abe said 'bout Sarah his wife, "She is my sister." And Abimelech king of Gerar sent n took Sarah.
Ge 20:3	And God came 2 Abimelech in a dream at night. And he said 2 him, "Look, u r a ded man on account of da woman u hav taken. Cuz she’s a married woman."
Ge 20:4	Now Abimelech hadn't approached her, so he said, "my Lord, will u even kill a gud ppl?"
Ge 20:5	Did not he himself tell me, 'She is my sister'? And she herself said, 'He is my bro.' Wit integrity of my heart n w cleanness of my hands i did dis."
Ge 20:6	Then God said 2 him in da dream, "Yeah, i kno dat in da integrity of yo heart u did dis, n i also kept u from sinning against me. So, i didn't allow u 2 touch her.
Ge 20:7	So now, return da wife of da man, 4 he’s a prophet, so dat he’ll pray 4 u n u will live. And if u don’t return her, kno dat u will totally die, n all dat r urs." 

Ge 20:8	So Abimelech rose early in da mornin’. And he called all his servants n told them all deez tingz, n da men were afraid af.
Ge 20:9	And Abimelech called 4 Abe n said 2 him, "Wut hav u done 2 us? And how hav i sinned against u dat u brought on me n on my kingdom a great sin? U hav done tingz 2 me dat shouldn’t be done."
Ge 20:10	And Abimelech said 2 Abe, "Wut were u thinking dat u did dis thang?"
Ge 20:11	And Abe said, "Cuz i thought, ofc there’s no fear of God in dis place; they’ll kill me on account of da matter of my wife.
Ge 20:12	Besides, she’s my sister, da daughter of my dad, but not da daughter of my mom. And she became my wife.
Ge 20:13	And it happened dat as God caused me 2 wander from da house of my dad i said 2 her, 'Dis is yo loyal kindness dat u must do 4 me at every place where we come: say abt me, "He is my bro." '"
Ge 20:14	And Abimelech took sheep n cattle n male slaves n female slaves, n he gave them 2 Abe. And he returned Sarah his wife 2 him.
Ge 20:15	And Abimelech said, "Here is my land b4 u; settle where it pleases u."
Ge 20:16	And 2 Sarah he said, "Look, i’ve given a K pieces of silver 2 yo bro. It will be an exoneration. U r vindicated b4 all who r w u."
Ge 20:17	And Abe prayed 2 God, n God healed Abimelech n his wife n his female servants so dat they could bear kids again.
Ge 20:18	Cuz YHWH had totally closed up all da wombs of da house of Abimelech cuz of da matter of Sarah, da wife of Abe. 


CHAPTER 21
Ge 21:1	And YHWH visited Sarah as he had said. And YHWH did 2 Sarah as he had promised.
Ge 21:2	And she conceived, n Sarah bore 2 Abe a son in his old age at da appointed time dat God had told him.
Ge 21:3	And Abe called da name of his son who wuz born 2 him, whom Sarah bore 2 him, Isaac.
Ge 21:4	And Abe cut Isaac his son when he wuz 8 days old, as God had commanded him.
Ge 21:5	And Abe wuz 1 hundred yrs old when Isaac his son wuz born 2 him.
Ge 21:6	And Sarah said, "God haz made laughter 4 me; all who hear will laugh 4 me."
Ge 21:7	And she said, "Who would announce 2 Abe dat Sarah would nurse kids? Yet i’ve borne a son 2 Abe in his old age." 

Ge 21:8	And da kid grew n wuz weaned. And Abe made a great feast on da day Isaac wuz weaned.
Ge 21:9	And Sarah saw da son of Hagar da Egyptian, whom she had borne Abe, roasting.
Ge 21:10	Then she said 2 Abe, "Drive out dis slave woman n her son, 4 da son of dis slave woman won’t be heir w my son, w Isaac."
Ge 21:11	And da matter displeased Abe much af on account of his son.
Ge 21:12	Then God said 2 Abe, "Don’t be displeased on account of da boi n on account of da slave woman. Listen 2 everythin’ dat Sarah said 2 u, 4 thru Isaac yo offspring gonna be named.
Ge 21:13	And i’ll also make da son of da slave woman into a nation, 4 he’s yo offspring."
Ge 21:14	Then Abe rose up early in da mornin’ n took bread n a skin of water n gave it 2 Hagar, putting it on her shoulder. And he sent her away w da kid, n she went, wandering 'bout in da wilderness, in Beersheba.
Ge 21:15	And when da water wuz finished from da skin, she put da kid under 1 of da bushes.
Ge 21:16	And she went n she sat a gud distance away, 4 she said, "Let me not c da kid's death." So she sat away from him n lifted up her voice n cried.
Ge 21:17	And God heard da cri of da boi n da angel of God called 2 Hagar from da heavens n said 2 her, "Wut is da matter Hagar? Don’t be afraid, 4 God haz heard da cri of da boi from where he’s.
Ge 21:18	Get up, take up da boi n take him w yo hand, cuz i’ll make him a great nation."
Ge 21:19	And God opened her eyes, n she saw a well of water. And she went n filled da skin w water n gave a drink 2 da boi.
Ge 21:20	And God wuz w da boi, n he grew n lived in da wilderness. And he became an expert w a bow.
Ge 21:21	And he lived in da wilderness of Paran. And his mom took a wife 4 him from da land of Egypt. 

Ge 21:22	And it happened dat at dat time, Abimelech n Phicol, da commander of his army, said 2 Abe, "God is w u, in all dat u do.
Ge 21:23	So now, swear 2 me here by God dat u won’t deal w me falsely, or w my descendants, or my posterity. According 2 da kindness dat i’ve done 2 u, u will pledge 2 do w me n w da land where u hav dwelled as an alien."
Ge 21:24	And Abe said, "i swear."
Ge 21:25	Then Abe complained 2 Abimelech on account of da well of water dat servants of Abimelech had seized.
Ge 21:26	And Abimelech said, "idk who did dis thang, neither did u tell me, nor hav i heard of it except 4 2day."
Ge 21:27	And Abe took sheep n cattle n gave them 2 Abimelech. And da 2 of them made a covenant.
Ge 21:28	Then Abe set off 7 ewe-lambs of da flock by themselves.
Ge 21:29	And Abimelech said 2 Abe, "Wut is da meaning of deez 7 ewe-lambs dat u hav set off by themselves?"
Ge 21:30	And he said, "U will take da 7 ewe-lambs from my hand as proof on my behalf dat i dug dis well."
Ge 21:31	So dat place is called Beersheba, cuz there da 2 of them swore an oath.
Ge 21:32	And they made a covenant at Beersheba. And Abimelech, n Phicol his army commander stood n returned 2 da land of da Philistines.
Ge 21:33	And he planted a tamarisk tree in Beersheba, n there he called on da name of YHWH, da everlasting God.
Ge 21:34	And Abe dwelled as an alien in da land of da Philistines many days. 


CHAPTER 22
Ge 22:1	And it happened dat after deez tingz, God tested Abe. And he said 2 him, "Abe!" And he said, "Here im."
Ge 22:2	And he said, "Take yo son, yo only kid, Isaac, whom u luv, n go 2 da land of Moriah, n offer him there as a burnt offering on 1 of da mountains where i’ll tell u."
Ge 22:3	And Abe rose up early in da mornin’ n saddled his donkey. And he took 2 of his servants w him, n Isaac his son. And he chopped wood 4 a burnt offering. And he got up n went 2 da place which God had told him.
Ge 22:4	On da 3rd day Abe lifted up his eyes, n he saw da place at a distance.
Ge 22:5	And Abe said 2 his servants, "U stay here w da donkey, n i n da boi will go up there. We will worship, then we'll return 2 u."
Ge 22:6	And Abe took da wood of da burnt offering n placed it on Isaac his son. And he took da fire in his hand n da knife, n da 2 of them went together.
Ge 22:7	And Isaac said 2 Abe his dad, "My dad!" And he said, "Here im, my son." And he said, "Here is da fire n da wood, but where’s da lamb 4 a burnt offering?"
Ge 22:8	And Abe said, "God will provide da lamb 4 a burnt offering, my son." And da 2 of them went together. 

Ge 22:9	And they came 2 da place dat God had told him. And Abe built an altar there n arranged da wood. Then he bound Isaac his son n placed him on da altar atop da wood.
Ge 22:10	And Abe stretched out his hand n took da knife 2 slaughter his son.
Ge 22:11	And da angel of YHWH called 2 him from heaven n said, "Abe! Abe!" And he said, "Here im."
Ge 22:12	And he said, "Don’t stretch out yo hand against da boi; don’t do anythin’ 2 him. Cuz now i kno dat u r 1 who fears God, since u haven't withheld yo son, yo only kid, from me."
Ge 22:13	And Abe lifted up his eyes n looked. And look, a ram wuz caught in da thicket by his horns. And Abe went n took da ram, n offered it as a burnt offering in place of his son.
Ge 22:14	And Abe called da name of dat place "YHWH will provide," 4 which reason it’s said 2day, "on da mountain of YHWH it’ll be provided."
Ge 22:15	And da angel of YHWH called 2 Abe a 2nd time from heaven.
Ge 22:16	And he said, "i swear by myself, declares YHWH, dat cuz u hav done dis thang n haven't withheld yo son, yo only kid,
Ge 22:17	dat i’ll totally bless u n greatly multiply yo offspring as da stars of heaven, n as da sand dat’s by da shore of da sea. And yo offspring will take possession of da gate of his enemies.
Ge 22:18	All da nations of da earth gonna be blessed thru yo offspring, cuz u hav listened 2 my voice."
Ge 22:19	And Abe returned 2 his servants, n they got up n went together 2 Beersheba. And Abe lived in Beersheba. 

Ge 22:20	And it happened dat after deez tingz, 'twas told 2 Abe, "Look, Milcah haz also borne kids 2 yo bro Nahor:
Ge 22:21	Uz his firstborn n Buz his bro, n Kemuel da dad of Aram,
Ge 22:22	n Kesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph, n Bethuel."
Ge 22:23	(Now, Bethuel fathered Rebekah). Deez 8 Milcah bore 2 Nahor, da bro of Abe.
Ge 22:24	And his concubine, whose name wuz Reumah, also bore Tebah, Gaham, Tahash, n Maacah. 


CHAPTER 23
Ge 23:1	And Sarah lived 1 hundred n 20-7 yrs; deez were da yrs of da lyf of Sarah.
Ge 23:2	And Sarah died in Kiriath Arba; dat’s Hebron, in da land of Canaan.
Ge 23:3	And Abe went 2 mourn 4 Sarah n 2 cri 4 her. And Abe rose up from his ded, n he spoke 2 da Hittites n said,
Ge 23:4	"im a stranger n an alien among u; give 2 me my own burial site among u so dat i may bury my ded from b4 me."
Ge 23:5	And da Hittites answered Abe n said 2 him,
Ge 23:6	"Hear us, my lord, u r a mighty prince in our midst. Bury yo ded in da choicest of our burial sites. None of us will withhold his burial site from u 4 burying yo ded."
Ge 23:7	And Abe rose up n bowed 2 da ppl of da land, 2 da Hittites.
Ge 23:8	And he spoke w them, sayin’, "If u r willing dat i bury my ded from b4 me, hear me n intercede 4 me w Ephron da son of Zohar,
Ge 23:9	dat he may sell 2 me da cave of Machpelah which belongs 2 him, which is at da end of his field. At full value let him sell it 2 me in yo midst as a burial site."
Ge 23:10	Now Ephron wuz sitting among da Hittites. And Ephron da Hittite answered Abe in da hearing of da Hittites w respeck 2 all who were entering da gate of his city, n said,
Ge 23:11	"No, my lord, hear me. i give u da field n da cave which is in it, i also give it 2 u in da sight of da kids of my ppl i give it 2 u. Bury yo ded."
Ge 23:12	And Abe bowed b4 da ppl of da land.
Ge 23:13	And he spoke 2 Ephron in da hearing of da ppl of da land, sayin’, "If only u will hear me--i give da price of da field. Take it from me dat i may bury my ded there."
Ge 23:14	And Ephron answered Abe, sayin’ 2 him,
Ge 23:15	"My lord, hear me. A piece of land worth 4 hundred shekels of silver--wut is dat between me n u? Bury yo ded."
Ge 23:16	Then Abe listened 2 Ephron, n Abe weighed 4 Ephron da silver dat he had named in da hearing of da Hittites: 4 hundred shekels of silver at da merchants' current rate.
Ge 23:17	So da field of Ephron which wuz in da Machpelah, which wuz near Mamre--da field n da cave which wuz in it, w all da trees dat were in da field, which were within all its surrounding boundaries--passed
Ge 23:18	2 Abe as a property in da presence of da Hittites, w respeck 2 all who were entering da gate of his city.
Ge 23:19	And so afterward Abe buried Sarah his wife in da cave of da field of Machpelah near Mamre; dat’s Hebron, in da land of Canaan.
Ge 23:20	And da field n da cave which wuz in it passed 2 Abe as a burial site from da Hittites. 


CHAPTER 24
Ge 24:1	Now Abe wuz old, advanced in age, n YHWH had blessed Abe in everythin’.
Ge 24:2	And Abe said 2 his servant, da oldest of his house, who had charge of all he had, "Please put yo hand under my thigh
Ge 24:3	dat i may make u swear by YHWH, da God of heaven n da God of earth, dat u won’t take a wife 4 my son from da daughters of da Canaanites in whose midst im dwelling,
Ge 24:4	but dat u will go 2 my land n 2 my fam, n take a wife 4 my son, 4 Isaac."
Ge 24:5	And da servant said 2 him, "Maybe da woman won’t be willing 2 follow me 2 dis land--must i then return yo son 2 da land from whence u came?"
Ge 24:6	Abe said 2 him, "U must take care dat u don’t return my son there.
Ge 24:7	YHWH, da God of heaven who took me from da house of my dad n from da land of my fam, n who spoke 2 me n swore 2 me, sayin’, '2 yo offspring i’ll give dis land,' he’ll send his angel b4 u, n u will take a wife 4 my son from there.
Ge 24:8	And if da woman isn’t willing 2 follow u, then u will be released from dis oath of mine--only u must not return my son there."
Ge 24:9	Then da servant put his hand under da thigh of Abe his master, n he swore 2 him abt dis matter.
Ge 24:10	And da servant took 10 camels from his master's camels, n he went w all kinds of his master's gud tingz in his hand. And he arose n went 2 Aram-Naharaim, 2 da city of Nahor.
Ge 24:11	And he made da camels kneel outside da city at da well of water, at da time of evening, toward da time da women went out 2 draw water.
Ge 24:12	And he said, "O YHWH, God of my master Abe, please grant me success 2day n show loyal luv 2 my master Abe.
Ge 24:13	Look, im standing by da spring of water, n da daughters of da men of da city r goin’ out 2 draw water.
Ge 24:14	And let it be dat da girl 2 whom i’ll say, 'Please, offer yo jar dat i may drink' n who says, 'Drink--n i’ll also water yo camels,' she’s da 1 u hav chosen 4 yo servant, 4 Isaac. By her i’ll kno dat u hav shown loyal luv 2 my master."
Ge 24:15	And it happened dat b4 he had finished talkin’, look, Rebekah--who wuz born 2 Bethuel, son of Milcah, da wife of Nahor, da bro of Abe--came out, n her jar wuz on her shoulder.
Ge 24:16	Now da girl wuz very pleasing in appearance. She wuz a virgin; no man had known her. And she went down 2 da spring, filled her jar, n came up.
Ge 24:17	And da servant ran 2 meet her. And he said, "Please, let me drink a lil’ of da water from yo jar."
Ge 24:18	And she said, "Drink, my lord." And she quickly lowered her jar in her hand n gave him a drink.
Ge 24:19	When she finished giving him a drink she said, "i’ll also draw water 4 yo camels until they finish drinking."
Ge 24:20	And she quickly emptied her jar into da trough n ran again 2 da well 2 draw water. And she drew water 4 all his camels.
Ge 24:21	And da man wuz gazing at her silently 2 kno if YHWH had made his journey successful or not.
Ge 24:22	And it happened dat as da camels finished drinking da man took a gold ring of a half shekel in weight n 2 bracelets 4 her arms, 10 shekels in weight,
Ge 24:23	n said, "Please tell me, whose daughter r u? Is there a place at da house of yo dad 4 us 2 spend da night?"
Ge 24:24	And she said 2 him, "im da daughter of Bethuel, son of Milcah, whom she bore 2 Nahor."
Ge 24:25	Then she said 2 him, "We hav both straw n fodder in abundance, as well as a place 2 spend da night."
Ge 24:26	And da man knelt down n worshiped YHWH.
Ge 24:27	And he said, "Blessed be YHWH, God of my master Abe, who hasn't withheld his loyal luv n his faithfulness from my master. i wuz on da wey n YHWH led me 2 da house of my master's bro."
Ge 24:28	Then da girl ran n reported deez tingz 2 da household of her mom. 

Ge 24:29	Now Rebekah had a bro, n his name wuz Laban. And Laban ran out 2 da man toward da spring.
Ge 24:30	And when he saw da ring n da bracelets on da arms of his sister n heard da words of Rebekah his sister, who said, "So da man spoke 2 me," he went 2 da man. And look, he wuz standing w da camels at da spring.
Ge 24:31	And he said, "Come, O blessed 1 of YHWH. Y do u stand outside? Now i’ve prepared da house n a place 4 da camels."
Ge 24:32	And da man came 2 da house n unloaded da camels. And he gave straw n fodder 2 da camels, n water 2 wash his feet n da feet of da men who were w him.
Ge 24:33	And food wuz placed b4 him 2 eat. And he said, "i’ll not eat until i’ve told my errand." And he said, "Talk."
Ge 24:34	And he said, "im da servant of Abe.
Ge 24:35	Now YHWH haz blessed my master exceedingly, n he’s become great. He haz given 2 him sheep n cattle, silver n gold, male slaves n female slaves, n camels n donkeys.
Ge 24:36	And Sarah, da wife of my master, haz borne a son 2 my master after her old age. And he’s given 2 him all dat he’s.
Ge 24:37	And my master made me swear, sayin’, 'Don’t take a wife 4 my son from da daughters of da Canaanites in whose land im livin’.
Ge 24:38	But u will go 2 da house of my dad, n 2 my fam, n u will take a wife 4 my son.'
Ge 24:39	And i said 2 my master, 'Maybe da woman won’t follow me.'
Ge 24:40	And he said 2 me, 'YHWH, b4 whom i’ve walked, will send his angel w u n will make yo journey successful. And u will take a wife 4 my son from my fam, n from da house of my dad.
Ge 24:41	Then u will be released from my oath, when u come 2 my fam. And if they’ll not give a woman 2 u, then u gonna be released from my oath.'
Ge 24:42	Then 2day i came 2 da spring, n i said, 'O YHWH, God of my master Abe, if u would please make my journey successful, on which im goin’.
Ge 24:43	Look, im standing by da spring of water. Let it be dat da yung woman who comes out 2 draw water n 2 whom i say, "Please gimme a lil’ water 2 drink from yo jar,"
Ge 24:44	let her tell me, "Drink; i’ll also draw water 4 yo camels," she’s da woman whom YHWH haz appointed 4 da son of my master.'
Ge 24:45	i hadn't yet finished talkin’ 2 myself when, look, Rebekah wuz comin’ out w her jar on her shoulder. And she went down 2 da spring n drew water. And i said 2 her, 'Please gimme a drink.'
Ge 24:46	And she hastened n let down her jar from her shoulder n said, 'Drink, n i’ll give a drink 2 yo camels also.' Then i drank n she gave a drink 2 da camels also.
Ge 24:47	Then i asked her n said, 'Whose daughter r u?' And she said, 'Da daughter of Bethuel, son of Nahor, whom Milcah bore 2 him.' And i put da ring on her nose n da bracelets on her arms.
Ge 24:48	And i knelt down n worshiped YHWH, n i praised YHWH, da God of my master Abe, who led me on da right wae, 2 take da daughter of da bro of my master 4 his son.
Ge 24:49	So now, if u r goin’ 2 deal loyally n fr w my master, tell me. And if not, tell me, so dat i may turn 2 da right or 2 da left."
Ge 24:50	Then Laban n Bethuel answered, n they said, "Da matter haz gone out from YHWH; we aren’t able 2 talk bad or gud 2 u.
Ge 24:51	Here is Rebekah b4 u. Take her n go; let her be a wife 4 da son of yo master as YHWH haz spoken."
Ge 24:52	And it happened dat when da servant of Abe heard their words he bowed down 2 da ground 2 YHWH.
Ge 24:53	And da servant brought out silver jewelry n gold jewelry, n garments, n he gave them 2 Rebekah. And he gave precious gifts 2 her bro n 2 her mom.
Ge 24:54	And he n da men who were w him ate n drank, n they spent da night. And they got up in da mornin’, n he said, "Let me go 2 my master."
Ge 24:55	And her bro n her mom said, "Let da girl remain w us 10 days or so; after dat she may go."
Ge 24:56	And he said 2 them, "Don’t delay me. Now, YHWH haz made my journey successful. Let me go. i must go 2 my master."
Ge 24:57	And they said, "Let us call da girl n ask her opinion."
Ge 24:58	And they called Rebekah n said 2 her, "Will u go w dis man?" And she said, "i’ll go."
Ge 24:59	So they sent away Rebekah their sister, n her nurse, n da servant of Abe n his men.
Ge 24:60	And they blessed Rebekah n said 2 her, "U r our sister; may u become countless thousands; n may yo offspring take possession of da gate of his enemies."
Ge 24:61	And Rebekah n her maidservants arose, n they mounted da camels n followed da man. And da servant took Rebekah n left. 

Ge 24:62	Now Isaac wuz comin’ from da direction of Beer-Lahai-Roi. And he wuz livin’ in da land of da Negev.
Ge 24:63	And Isaac went out 2 meditate in da field early in da evening, n he lifted up his eyes n saw--look, camels were comin’.
Ge 24:64	And Rebekah lifted up her eyes n saw Isaac. And she got down from da camel.
Ge 24:65	And she said 2 da servant, "Who is dis man walking around in da field 2 meet us?" And da servant said, "Dat is my master." And she took her veil n covered herself.
Ge 24:66	And da servant told Isaac all da tingz dat he had done.
Ge 24:67	And Isaac brought her 2 da tent of Sarah his mom. And he took Rebekah, n she became his wife. And Isaac luvd her n wuz comforted after da death of his mom. 


CHAPTER 25
Ge 25:1	Now Abe again took a wife, n her name wuz Keturah.
Ge 25:2	And she bore 2 him Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, n Shuah.
Ge 25:3	And Jokshan fathered Sheba n Dedan. And da sons of Dedan were Asshurim n Letushim n Leummim.
Ge 25:4	And da sons of Midian were Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abidah, n Eldaah. All of deez were da kids of Keturah.
Ge 25:5	And Abe gave all he had 2 Isaac.
Ge 25:6	But 2 da sons of Abe's concubines Abe gave gifts. And while he wuz still livin’ he sent them away eastward, away from his son Isaac, 2 da land of da east.
Ge 25:7	Now deez r da days of da yrs of da lyf of Abe: 1 hundred n seventy-5 yrs.
Ge 25:8	And Abe passed away n died in a gud old age, old n full of yrs. And he wuz gathered 2 his ppl.
Ge 25:9	And Isaac n Ishmael his sons buried him in da cave of Machpelah, in da field of Ephron, son of Zohar da Hittite, dat wuz east of Mamre,
Ge 25:10	da field dat Abe had bought from da Hittites. There Abe wuz buried n Sarah his wife.
Ge 25:11	And it happened dat after da death of Abe God blessed Isaac his son, n Isaac settled at Beer-Lahai-Roi. 

Ge 25:12	Now deez r da gens of Ishmael, da son of Abe, dat Hagar da Egyptian, da maidservant of Sarah, bore 2 Abe.
Ge 25:13	And deez r da names of da sons of Ishmael, by their names accordin’ 2 their fam records. Da firstborn of Ishmael wuz Nebaioth, then Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam,
Ge 25:14	Mishma, Dumah, Massa,
Ge 25:15	Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, n Kedemah.
Ge 25:16	Deez r da sons of Ishmael, n deez r their names by their villages n by their encampments--12 leaders accordin’ 2 their tribes.
Ge 25:17	Now deez r da yrs of da lyf of Ishmael: 137 yrs. And he passed away n died, n wuz gathered 2 his ppl.
Ge 25:18	They settled from Havilah 2 Shur, which wuz opposite Egypt, goin’ toward Asshur, opposite; he settled opposite all his bros. 

Ge 25:19	Now deez r da gens of Isaac, da son of Abe. Abe fathered Isaac,
Ge 25:20	And Isaac wuz forty yrs old when he took Rebekah, da daughter of Bethuel da Aramean of Paddan-Aram, da sister of Laban da Aramean, as his wife.
Ge 25:21	And Isaac prayed 2 YHWH on behalf of his wife, 4 she wuz barren. And YHWH responded 2 his prayer, n Rebekah his wife conceived.
Ge 25:22	And da kids in her womb jostled each other, n she said, "If it’s goin’ 2 be like dis, y be preggers?" And she went 2 inquire of YHWH.
Ge 25:23	And YHWH said 2 her, "2 nations r in yo womb, n 2 peoples from birth will be divided. And 1 ppl will be stronger than da other. And da elder will serve da younger."
Ge 25:24	And when her days 2 give birth were completed, then--look--twins were in her womb.
Ge 25:25	And da 1st came out red, all his body wuz like a hairy coat, so they called his name Esau.
Ge 25:26	And afterward his bro came out, n his hand grasped da heel of Esau, so his name wuz called Jake. And Isaac wuz sixty yrs old at their birth.
Ge 25:27	And da bois grew up. And Esau wuz a skilled hunter, a man of da field, but Jake wuz a peaceful man, livin’ in tents.
Ge 25:28	And Isaac luvd Esau cuz he could eat of his game, but Rebekah luvd Jake.
Ge 25:29	Once Jake cooked a thicc stew, n Esau came in from da field, n he wuz exhausted.
Ge 25:30	And Esau said 2 Jake, "Give me some of dat red stuff 2 gulp down, cuz im exhausted!" (So his name wuz called Edom).
Ge 25:31	Then Jake said, "Sell me yo birthright 1st."
Ge 25:32	And Esau said, "Look, im goin’ 2 die; now wut is dis birthright 2 me?"
Ge 25:33	Then Jake said, "Swear 2 me 1st." And he swore 2 him, n sold his birthright 2 Jake.
Ge 25:34	Then Jake gave Esau bread, n thicc lentil stew, n he ate n drank. Then he got up n went away. So Esau hated his birthright. 


CHAPTER 26
Ge 26:1	And there wuz a famine in da land, besides da former famine which wuz in da days of Abe. And Isaac went 2 Abimelech, king of da Philistines, 2 Gerar.
Ge 26:2	And YHWH appeared 2 him n said, "Don’t go down 2 Egypt; dwell in da land which i’ll show 2 u.
Ge 26:3	Dwell as an alien in dis land, n i gonna be w u, n will bless u, cuz i’ll give all deez lands 2 u n 2 yo descendants, n i’ll establish da oath dat i swore 2 Abe u dad.
Ge 26:4	And i’ll multiply yo descendants like da stars of heaven, n i’ll give 2 yo descendants all deez lands. And all nations of da earth gonna be blessed thru yo offspring,
Ge 26:5	cuz Abe listened 2 my voice n kept my charge: my rules, my statutes, n my laws." 

Ge 26:6	So Isaac settled in Gerar.
Ge 26:7	When da men of da place asked abt his wife, he said, "She is my sister," 4 he wuz afraid 2 say, "my wife," thinking "da men of da place will kill me on account of Rebekah, 4 she wuz beautiful."
Ge 26:8	And it happened dat, when he had been there a long time, Abimelech da king of da Philistines looked thru da window, n saw--look--Isaac wuz fondling Rebekah his wife.
Ge 26:9	And Abimelech called Isaac n said, "Ofc she’s yo wife. Now y did u say 'She is my sister'?" And Isaac said 2 him, "Cuz i thought i’d die on account of her."
Ge 26:10	And Abimelech said, "Wut is dis u hav done 2 us? 1 of da ppl might easily hav slept w yo wife! Then u would’ve brought guilt on us!"
Ge 26:11	Then Abimelech instructed all da ppl, sayin’, "Da 1 who touches dis man or his wife will totally die." 

Ge 26:12	And Isaac sowed in dat land n reaped in dat same yr a hundredfold, n YHWH blessed him.
Ge 26:13	And da man became wealthier n wealthier until he wuz exceedingly wealthy.
Ge 26:14	And he possessed sheep n cattle n many servants, so dat da Philistines envied him.
Ge 26:15	And da Philistines stopped up all da wells dat da servants of his dad had dug in da days of Abe his dad. They filled them w earth.
Ge 26:16	And Abimelech said 2 Isaac, "Go away from us, 4 u hav become much too powerful 4 us."
Ge 26:17	So Isaac departed from there n camped in da valley of Gerar, n settled there.
Ge 26:18	And Isaac dug again da wells of water which they had dug in da days of his dad Abe, which da Philistines had stopped up after da death of Abe. And he gave 2 them da same names which his dad had given them.
Ge 26:19	And when da servants of Isaac dug in da valley, they found a well of fresh water there.
Ge 26:20	Then da herdsmen of Gerar quarreled w da herdsmen of Isaac, sayin’, "Da water is ours." And he called da name of da well Esek, cuz they contended w him.
Ge 26:21	And they dug anotha well, n they quarreled over it also. And he called its name Sitnah.
Ge 26:22	Then he moved from there n dug anotha well, n they didn't quarrel over it. And he called its name Rehoboth, n said, "Now YHWH haz made room 4 us, n we will be fruitful in da land."
Ge 26:23	And from there he went up 2 Beersheba.
Ge 26:24	And YHWH appeared 2 him dat night n said, "im da God of yo dad Abe. Don’t be afraid, cuz im w u, n i’ll bless u n make yo descendants numerous 4 da sake of my servant Abe."
Ge 26:25	And he built an altar there n called on da name of YHWH. And he pitched his tent there, n da servants of Isaac dug a well there.
Ge 26:26	Then Abimelech went 2 him from Gerar w Ahuzzath his friend n Phicol his army commander.
Ge 26:27	And Isaac said 2 them, "Y hav u come 2 me? U h8 me n sent me away from u."
Ge 26:28	And they said, "We c clearly dat YHWH haz been w u, so we thought let there be an oath between us--between us n u--n let’s make a covenant w u
Ge 26:29	dat u may not do us harm just like we haven't touched u, but hav only done gud 2 u n sent u away in pce. U r now blessed by YHWH."
Ge 26:30	So he made a meal 4 them, n they ate n drank.
Ge 26:31	And they arose early in da mornin’ n each 1 swore 2 da other, n Isaac sent them away. And they left him in pce.
Ge 26:32	And it happened dat on dat same day da servants of Isaac came n told him 'bout da well dat they had dug. And they said, "We hav found water!"
Ge 26:33	And he called it Sheba. So da name of da city is Beersheba unto dis day. 

Ge 26:34	And when Esau wuz forty yrs old he took as wife Judith, daughter of Beeri da Hittite, n Basemath, daughter of Elon da Hittite.
Ge 26:35	And they made lyf bitter 4 Isaac n Rebekah. 


CHAPTER 27
Ge 27:1	And it happened dat when Isaac wuz old n his eyesight wuz weak, he called Esau his older son n said 2 him, "My son." And he said 2 him, "Here im."
Ge 27:2	And he said, "Look, im old; idk da day of my death.
Ge 27:3	So now, take yo weapons, yo quiver n yo bow, n go out 2 da field n hunt food 4 me.
Ge 27:4	Then make 4 me tasty food like i luv, n bring it 2 me. And i’ll eat it so dat i can bless u b4 i die. 

Ge 27:5	Now Rebekah wuz listening as Isaac spoke 2 Esau his son, n when Esau went 2 da field 2 hunt wild game 2 bring back,
Ge 27:6	Rebekah said 2 Jake her son, "Look, i heard yo dad talkin’ 2 Esau yo bro sayin’,
Ge 27:7	'Bring wild game 2 me n prepare tasty food so i can eat it n bless u b4 YHWH b4 my death.'
Ge 27:8	So now, my son, listen 2 my voice, 2 wut i command u.
Ge 27:9	Go 2 da flock n take 2 gud yung goats from it 4 me, n i’ll prepare them as tasty food 4 yo dad, just like he likes.
Ge 27:10	Then u must take it 2 yo dad n he’ll eat it so dat he may bless u b4 his death."
Ge 27:11	Then Jake said 2 his mom, "Look, Esau my bro is a hairy man, but im a smooth man.
Ge 27:12	Maybe my dad will feel me n i gonna be in his eyes as a mocker, n he’ll bring on me a curse n not a blessing."
Ge 27:13	Then his mom said 2 him, "Yo curse be on me, my son, only listen 2 my voice--go n get them 4 me."
Ge 27:14	So he went n took them, n brought them 2 his mom, n his mom prepared tasty food as his dad liked.
Ge 27:15	Then Rebekah took some of her older son Esau's best garments dat were w her in da house, n she put them on Jake her younger son.
Ge 27:16	And she put da skins of da yung goats over his hands n over da smooth part of his neck.
Ge 27:17	And she put da tasty food n da bread dat she had made into da hand of Jake, her son.
Ge 27:18	And he went 2 his dad n said, "My dad." And he said, "Here im. Who r u, my son?"
Ge 27:19	And Jake said 2 his dad, "im Esau, yo firstborn. i’ve done as u told me. Please get up, sit up n eat from my wild game so dat u may bless me."
Ge 27:20	Then Isaac said 2 his son, "How did u find it so quickly, my son?" And he said, "Cuz YHWH yo God caused me 2 find it."
Ge 27:21	Then Isaac said 2 Jake, "Please, come near n let me feel u, my son. R u rly my son Esau or not?"
Ge 27:22	And Jake drew near 2 Isaac his dad. And he felt him n said, "Da voice is da voice of Jake, but da hands r da hands of Esau."
Ge 27:23	And he didn't recognize him cuz his hands were hairy like da hands of Esau his bro. And he blessed him.
Ge 27:24	And he said, "R u rly my son Esau?" And he said, "im."
Ge 27:25	Then he said, "Bring it near 2 me dat i may eat from da game of my son, so dat i may bless u." And he brought it 2 him, n he ate. And he brought wine 2 him, n he drank.
Ge 27:26	Then his dad Isaac said 2 him, "Come near n kiss me, my son."
Ge 27:27	And he drew near n kissed him. And he smelled da smell of his garments, n he blessed him n said, 
 "Look, da smell of my son is like da smell of a field dat YHWH haz blessed!
Ge 27:28	May God give u of da dew of heaven n of da fatness of da earth, n abundance of grain n new wine.
Ge 27:29	Let peoples serve u, n nations bow down 2 u; Be lord of yo bros, n may da sons of yo mom bow down 2 u. Cursed be those cursing u, n blessed be those blessing u."

Ge 27:30	And as soon as Isaac had finished blessing Jake, immediately after Jake had gone out from da presence of Isaac his dad, Esau his bro came back from his hunting.
Ge 27:31	He too prepared tasty food n brought it 2 his dad. And he said 2 his dad, "Let my dad arise n eat from da wild game of his son, dat u may bless me."
Ge 27:32	And Isaac his dad said 2 him, "Who r u?" And he said, "im yo son, yo firstborn, Esau."
Ge 27:33	Then Isaac trembled violently. Then he said, "Who then wuz he dat hunted wild game n brought it 2 me, n i ate it all b4 u came, n i blessed him? Moreover, he gonna be blessed!"
Ge 27:34	When Esau heard da words of his dad he cried out w a great n exceedingly bitter cri of distress. And he said 2 his dad, "Bless me as well, my dad!"
Ge 27:35	And he said, "Yo bro came in deceit n took yo blessing."
Ge 27:36	Then he said, "Isn't dat y he’s named Jake? He haz deceived me deez 2 times. He took my birthright n, look, now he’s taken my blessing!" Then he said, "Hav u not reserved a blessing 4 me?"
Ge 27:37	Then Isaac answered n said 2 Esau, "Look, i’ve made him lord over u n i’ve given him all his bros as servants, n w grain n wine i’ve sustained him. Now wut can i do 4 u, my son?"
Ge 27:38	And Esau said 2 his dad, "Hav u only 1 blessing, my dad? Bless me also, my dad!" And Esau lifted up his voice n cried.
Ge 27:39	Then Isaac his dad answered n said 2 him, 
 "Yo home will be from da fatness of da land, n from da dew of heaven above.
Ge 27:40	But by yo sword u will live, n u will serve yo bro. But it’ll be dat when free yoself u will tear off his yoke from yo neck.

Ge 27:41	Then Esau held a grudge against Jake on account of da blessing w which his dad had blessed him. And Esau said in his heart, "Da days of mourning 4 my dad r comin’, then i’ll kill Jake my bro."
Ge 27:42	But da words of Esau her older son were told 2 Rebekah. And she sent n called 4 her younger son Jake. And she said 2 him, "Look, Esau yo bro is consoling himself abt u, intending 2 kill u.
Ge 27:43	Now then, my son, listen 2 my voice; arise n flee 2 Haran 2 Laban my bro.
Ge 27:44	Stay w him a few days until da wrath of yo bro haz turned--
Ge 27:45	until da anger of yo bro turns from u n he’s forgotten wut u hav done 2 him. Then i’ll send n bring u from there. Y shud i lose da 2 of u in 1 day?"
Ge 27:46	Then Rebekah said 2 Isaac, "i loathe my lyf cuz of da Hittite women. If Jake takes a wife from Hittite women like deez, from da native women, wut am i livin’ 4?" 


CHAPTER 28
Ge 28:1	Then Isaac called Jake n blessed him. And he instructed him n said 2 him, "U must not take a wife from da daughters of Canaan.
Ge 28:2	Arise, go 2 Paddan-Aram, 2 da house of Bethuel, yo mom's dad, n take 4 yoself a wife from there, from da daughters of Laban yo mom's bro.
Ge 28:3	Now, may El-Shaddai bless u, n make u fruitful, n multiply u, so dat u become an assembly of peoples.
Ge 28:4	And may he give u da blessing of Abe, 2 u n 2 yo descendants w u, dat u may take possession of da land of yo sojourning, which God gave 2 Abe."
Ge 28:5	Then Isaac sent Jake away, n he went 2 Paddan-Aram, 2 Laban da son of Bethuel da Aramean, da bro of Rebekah, da mom of Jake n Esau.
Ge 28:6	Now Esau saw dat Isaac had blessed Jake n sent him away 2 Paddan-Aram, 2 take 4 himself a wife from there, n he blessed him n instructed him, sayin’, "U must not take a wife from da daughters of Canaan,"
Ge 28:7	n dat Jake listened 2 his dad n 2 his mom n went 2 Paddan-Aram.
Ge 28:8	Then Esau saw dat da daughters of Canaan were bad in da eyes of Isaac his dad,
Ge 28:9	then Esau went 2 Ishmael n took Mahalath, da daughter of Ishmael, son of Abe, sister of Nebaioth, as a wife, in addition 2 da wives he had. 

Ge 28:10	Then Jake went out from Beersheba n went 2 Haran.
Ge 28:11	And he arrived at a certain place n spent da night there, cuz da sun had set. And he took 1 of da stones of da place n put it under his head n slept at dat place.
Ge 28:12	And he dreamed, n look, a stairway wuz set on da earth, n its top touched da heavens. And look, angels of God were goin’ up n goin’ down on it.
Ge 28:13	And look, YHWH wuz standing beside him, n he said, "im YHWH, da God of Abe yo dad, n da God of Isaac. Da ground on which u were sleeping i’ll give 2 u n 2 yo descendants.
Ge 28:14	Yo descendants will be like da dust of da earth, n u will spread out 2 da west, n 2 da east, n 2 da north n 2 da south. And all da fams of da earth gonna be blessed thru u n thru yo descendants.
Ge 28:15	Now look, im w u, n i’ll keep u wherever u go. And i’ll bring u 2 dis land, cuz i’ll not leave u until i’ve done wut i’ve promised 2 u."
Ge 28:16	Then Jake awoke from his sleep n said, "Ofc YHWH is indeed in dis place n i didn't kno!"
Ge 28:17	Then he wuz afraid n said, "How awesome is dis place! Dis is nothin’ else than da house of God, n dis is da gate of heaven!"
Ge 28:18	And Jake rose early in da mornin’, n he took da stone dat he had put under his head n set it up as a stone pillar, n poured oil on top of it.
Ge 28:19	And he called da name of dat place Bethel; however, da name of da city wuz formerly Luz.
Ge 28:20	And Jake made a vow sayin’, "If God gonna be w me n protect me on dis wey dat im goin’, n gives me food 2 eat n clothing 2 wear,
Ge 28:21	n if i return in pce 2 da house of my dad, then YHWH will become my God.
Ge 28:22	And dis stone dat i’ve set up as a pillar will be da house of God, n of all dat u give 2 me i’ll totally give a 10th 2 u." 


CHAPTER 29
Ge 29:1	And Jake continued his journey n went 2 da land of da Easterners.
Ge 29:2	And he looked, n look, there wuz a well in da field, n look, there were 3 flocks of sheep lying beside it, 4 out of dat well da flocks were watered. And da stone on da mouth of da well wuz large.
Ge 29:3	And when all da flocks were gathered there, they rolled away da stone from da mouth of da well. And they watered da sheep n returned da stone on da mouth of da well 2 its place.
Ge 29:4	And Jake said 2 them, "My bros, where r u from?" And they said, "We r from Haran."
Ge 29:5	And he said 2 them, "Do u kno Laban, son of Nahor?" And they said, "We kno him."
Ge 29:6	And he said 2 them, "Is he well?" And they said, "He is well. Now look, Rachel his daughter is comin’ w da sheep."
Ge 29:7	And he said, "Look, it’s still broad daylight; it isn’t da time 4 da livestock 2 be gathered. Give water 2 da sheep n go, pasture them."
Ge 29:8	And they said, "We aren’t able, until all da flocks r gathered. Then da stone is rolled away from da mouth of da well, n we water da sheep."
Ge 29:9	While he wuz talkin’ w them, Rachel came w da sheep which belonged 2 her dad, 4 she wuz pasturing them.
Ge 29:10	And it happened dat, when Jake saw Rachel, da daughter of Laban, his mom's bro, n da sheep of Laban, his mom's bro, Jake drew near n rolled away da stone from da mouth of da well n watered da sheep of Laban, his mom's bro.
Ge 29:11	And Jake kissed Rachel, n lifted up his voice n cried.
Ge 29:12	And Jake told Rachel dat he wuz da relative of her dad, n dat he wuz da son of Rebekah. And she ran n told her dad.
Ge 29:13	And it happened dat when Laban heard da msg 'bout Jake, da son of his sister, he ran 2 meet him. And he embraced him n kissed him, n brought him 2 his house. And he told Laban all deez tingz.
Ge 29:14	And Laban said 2 him, "Ofc u r my flesh n my bone!" And he stayed w him a month. 

Ge 29:15	Then Laban said 2 Jake, "Just cuz u r my bro shud u work 4 me 4 nothin’? Tell me wut yo wage shud be."
Ge 29:16	Now Laban had 2 daughters. Da name of da older wuz Leah, n da name of da younger wuz Rachel.
Ge 29:17	Now da eyes of Leah were dull, but Rachel wuz beautiful in form n appearance.
Ge 29:18	And Jake luvd Rachel n said, "i’ll serve u 7 yrs 4 Rachel yo younger daughter."
Ge 29:19	Then Laban said, "Better dat i give her 2 u than i give her 2 anotha man. Stay w me."
Ge 29:20	And Jake worked 4 Rachel 7 yrs, but they were as a few days in his eyes cuz he luvd her.
Ge 29:21	And Jake said 2 Laban, "Give me my wife, dat i may go in 2 her, 4 my time is completed."
Ge 29:22	So Laban gathered all da men of da place n prepared a feast.
Ge 29:23	And it happened dat in da evening he took Leah his daughter n brought her 2 him, n he went in 2 her.
Ge 29:24	And Laban gave Zilpah his female servant 2 her, 2 Leah his daughter as a female servant.
Ge 29:25	And it happened dat in da mornin’, look, 'twas Leah! And he said 2 Laban, "Wut is dis u hav done 2 me? Did i not serve w u 4 Rachel? Now y did u deceive me?"
Ge 29:26	Then Laban said, "It isn’t da custom in our country 2 give da younger b4 da firstborn.
Ge 29:27	Complete da week of dis 1, then i’ll also give u da other, on da condition dat u will work 4 me anotha 7 yrs."
Ge 29:28	And Jake did so. So he completed da week of dis 1, then he gave Rachel his daughter 2 him as a wife.
Ge 29:29	And Laban gave Bilhah his female servant 2 Rachel his daughter as a female servant.
Ge 29:30	Then he also went in 2 Rachel, n he luvd Rachel more than Leah. And he served w him yet anotha 7 yrs. 

Ge 29:31	When YHWH saw dat Leah wuz unloved he opened her womb, but Rachel wuz barren.
Ge 29:32	Then Leah conceived n gave birth 2 a son, n she called his name Reuben, 4 she said, "Cuz YHWH haz noticed my misery, dat im unloved. Now my husband will luv me."
Ge 29:33	And she conceived again n gave birth 2 a son. And she said, "It’s cuz YHWH haz heard dat im unloved dat he gave me dis son also." And she called his name Simeon.
Ge 29:34	And she conceived again n gave birth 2 a son. Then she said, "Now dis time my husband gonna be joined 2 me, cuz i’ve borne him 3 sons." So, she called his name Levi.
Ge 29:35	And she conceived again n gave birth 2 a son. And she said, "Dis time i’ll praise YHWH." So she called his name Judah. And she ceased bearing kids. 


CHAPTER 30
Ge 30:1	When Rachel saw dat she couldn't bear kids 2 Jake, Rachel envied her sister. And she said 2 Jake, "Give me kids--if not, i’ll die!"
Ge 30:2	And Jake became angry w Rachel. And he said, "Am i in da place of God, who haz withheld from u da fruit of da womb?"
Ge 30:3	Then she said, "Here is my servant girl Bilhah; go in 2 her dat she may bear kids as my surrogate. Then i’ll even hav kids by her."
Ge 30:4	Then she gave him Bilhah, her female servant, as a wife, n Jake went in 2 her
Ge 30:5	And Bilhah conceived n gave birth 2 a son 4 Jake.
Ge 30:6	Then Rachel said, "God haz judged me, n haz also heard my voice, n haz given me a son." So she called his name Dan.
Ge 30:7	And Bilhah, Rachel's servant, conceived again n bore a 2nd son 2 Jake.
Ge 30:8	And Rachel said, "i’ve struggled a mighty struggle w my sister n hav prevailed." And she called his name Naphtali.
Ge 30:9	When Leah saw dat she had ceased bearing kids, she took Zilpah her female servant n gave her 2 Jake as a wife.
Ge 30:10	And Zilpah, da female slave of Leah, bore a son 2 Jake.
Ge 30:11	Then Leah said, "Gud fortune!" And she called his name Gad.
Ge 30:12	And Zilpah, Leah's female servant, bore a 2nd son 2 Jake.
Ge 30:13	Then Leah said, "How happy am i! Cuz women hav called me happy." So she called his name Asher. 

Ge 30:14	And in da days of da wheat harvest, Reuben went n found mandrakes in da field n he brought them 2 Leah his mom. And Rachel said 2 Leah, "Please gimme some of yo son's mandrakes."
Ge 30:15	And she said 2 her, "Is yo taking my husband such a smol thang dat u will also take da mandrakes of my son?" Then Rachel said, "Then he may sleep w u tonight in exchange 4 yo son's mandrakes."
Ge 30:16	When Jake came in from da field in da evening, Leah went out 2 meet him. And she said, "Come in 2 me, cuz i’ve hired u w my son's mandrakes." And he slept w her dat night.
Ge 30:17	And God listened 2 Leah n she conceived n gave birth 2 a 5th son 4 Jake.
Ge 30:18	Then Leah said, "God haz given me my wage since i gave my servant girl 2 my husband." And she called his name Issachar.
Ge 30:19	And Leah conceived again n gave birth 2 a 6th son 4 Jake.
Ge 30:20	And Leah said, "God haz endowed me w a gud gift. Dis time my husband will acknowledge me, cuz i bore him 6 sons." And she called his name Zebulun.
Ge 30:21	And afterward she gave birth 2 a daughter. And she called her name Dinah.
Ge 30:22	Then God remembered Rachel n listened 2 her, n God opened her womb.
Ge 30:23	And she conceived n gave birth 2 a son. And she said, "God haz taken away my disgrace."
Ge 30:24	And she called his name Joey, sayin’, "YHWH haz added 2 me anotha son." 

Ge 30:25	And it happened dat as soon as Rachel had given birth 2 Joey, Jake said 2 Laban, "Send me away dat i may go 2 my place n my land.
Ge 30:26	Give me my wives n my kids 4 which i’ve served u, n let me go. Cuz u yoself kno my service dat i’ve rendered 2 u."
Ge 30:27	But Laban said 2 him, "Please, if i’ve found favor in yo eyes, i’ve learned by divination dat YHWH haz blessed me cuz of u."
Ge 30:28	And he said, "Name yo wage 2 me n i’ll give it."
Ge 30:29	Then he said 2 him, "U yoself kno how i’ve served u n how yo livestock hav been w me.
Ge 30:30	Cuz u had lil’ b4 me, n it’s increased abundantly. And YHWH haz blessed u wherever i turned. So then, when will i provide 4 my own fam also?"
Ge 30:31	And he said, "Wut will i give u?" And Jake said, "Don’t gimme anythin’. If u will do dis thang 4 me, i’ll again feed yo flocks n keep them.
Ge 30:32	Let me pass thru all yo flocks 2day, removing all da speckled n spotted sheep from them, along w every dark-colored sheep among da sheep, n da spotted n speckled among da goats. Dat will be my wages.
Ge 30:33	And my righteousness will answer 4 me later when u come abt my wages b4 u. Every 1 dat isn’t speckled or spotted among da goats, or dark-colored among da sheep will be stolen if it’s w me."
Ge 30:34	Then Laban said, "Look! Very well. It will be accordin’ 2 yo word."
Ge 30:35	But dat day he removed da streaked n spotted male goats n all da speckled n spotted female goats, all dat had white on it, n every dark-colored ram, n put them in da charge of his sons.
Ge 30:36	And he put a journey of 3 days between him n Jake, n Jake pastured da remainder of Laban's flock.
Ge 30:37	Then Jake took fresh branches of poplar, almond, n plane trees n peeled white strips on them, exposing da white which wuz on da branches.
Ge 30:38	And he set da branches dat he had peeled in front of da flocks, in da troughs n in da water containers. And they were in heat when they came 2 drink.
Ge 30:39	And da flocks mated by da branches, so da flocks bore streaked, speckled, n spotted.
Ge 30:40	And Jake separated da lambs n turned da faces of da flocks toward da streaked n all da dark-colored in Laban's flocks. And he put his own herds apart, n didn't put them w da flocks of Laban.
Ge 30:41	And whenever any of da stronger of da flocks were in heat, Jake put da branches in full view of da flock in da troughs dat they might m8 among da branches.
Ge 30:42	But w da more feeble of da flock he’d not put them there. So da feebler were Laban's n da stronger were Jake's.
Ge 30:43	And da man became exceedingly rich n had large flocks, female slaves, male slaves, camels, n donkeys. 


CHAPTER 31
Ge 31:1	Now he heard da words of da sons of Laban, sayin’, "Jake haz taken all dat our dad haz," n "From dat which wuz our dad's he’s gained all dis wealth."
Ge 31:2	Then Jake saw da face of Laban n, look, 'twas not like it had been in da past.
Ge 31:3	And YHWH said 2 Jake, "Return 2 da land of yo ancestors n 2 yo fam, n i gonna be w u."
Ge 31:4	So Jake sent n called Rachel n Leah 2 da field, 2 his flocks,
Ge 31:5	n he said 2 them, "Look, i c da face of yo dad, dat it isn’t like it’s been toward me in da past. But da God of my dad is w me.
Ge 31:6	Now u yoselves kno dat i’ve served yo dad w all my strength,
Ge 31:7	n yo dad haz cheated me n changed my wages 10 times, but God hasn't allowed him 2 harm me.
Ge 31:8	If so he said, 'Speckled will be yo wage,' then all da flock bore speckled. And if he said, 'Streaked will be yo wage,' then all da flock bore streaked.
Ge 31:9	God haz taken away yo dad's livestock n given them 2 me.
Ge 31:10	Now it happened dat at da time of da mating of da flock i lifted up my eyes n saw in a dream, n look, da rams mounting da flock were streaked, speckled, n dappled.
Ge 31:11	Then da angel of God said 2 me in da dream, 'Jake,' n i said, 'Here im.'
Ge 31:12	And he said, 'Lift up yo eyes n c--all da rams mounting da flock r streaked, speckled, n dappled, cuz i’ve seen all dat Laban is doin’ 2 u.
Ge 31:13	im da God of Bethel where u anointed a stone pillar, where u made a vow 2 me. Now get up, go out from dis land n return 2 da land of yo birth.'"
Ge 31:14	Then Rachel n Leah answered n said 2 him, "Is there yet a portion 4 us, n an inheritance in da house of our dad?
Ge 31:15	R we not regarded as foreigners by him, cuz he’s sold us n totally consumed our money?
Ge 31:16	Cuz all da wealth dat God haz taken away from our dad, it belongs 2 us n 2 our sons. So now, all dat God haz said 2 u, do."
Ge 31:17	Then Jake got up n put his kids n his wives on da camels.
Ge 31:18	And he drove all his livestock n his possessions dat he had acquired, da livestock of his possession dat he had acquired in Paddan-Aram, in order 2 go 2 Isaac his dad, 2 da land of Canaan. 

Ge 31:19	Now Laban had gone 2 shear his sheep, n Rachel stole da idols dat belonged 2 her dad.
Ge 31:20	And Jake tricked Laban da Aramean by not telling him dat he planned 2 flee.
Ge 31:21	Then he fled w all dat he had, n arose n crossed da Euphrates n set his face toward da hill country of Gilead.
Ge 31:22	And on da 3rd day 'twas told 2 Laban dat Jake had fled.
Ge 31:23	Then he took his kinsmen w him n pursued after him, a 7-day journey, n he caught up w him in da hill country of Gilead.
Ge 31:24	And God came 2 Laban da Aramean in a dream at night n said 2 him, "Take care dat u not talk w Jake, whether gud or bad."
Ge 31:25	And Laban overtook Jake. Now Jake had pitched his tent in da hill country, n Laban n his kinsmen pitched their tents in da hill country of Gilead.
Ge 31:26	Then Laban said 2 Jake, "Wut hav u done dat u tricked me n hav carried off my daughters like captives of da sword?
Ge 31:27	Y did u hide yo intention 2 flee n trick me, n didn't tell me so dat i’d hav sent u away w happiness n song n tambourine n lyre?
Ge 31:28	And y did u not gimme opportunity 2 kiss my grandsons n my daughters goodbye? Now u hav behaved stupidly by doin’ dis.
Ge 31:29	It’s in my power 2 do harm 2 u, but da God of yo dad spoke 2 me last night sayin’, 'Take care from talkin’ w Jake, whether gud or bad.'
Ge 31:30	Now, u hav ofc gone cuz u desperately longed 4 da house of yo dad, but y did u steal my gods?"
Ge 31:31	Then Jake answered n said 2 Laban, "Cuz i wuz afraid, cuz i thought, 'Lest u take yo daughters from me by force.'
Ge 31:32	But w whomever u find yo gods, he’ll not live. In da presence of yo kinsmen now identify wut is w me dat’s urs n take it." Now Jake didn't kno dat Rachel had stolen them.
Ge 31:33	Then Laban went into Jake's tent n Leah's tent n da tent of da 2 female servants n didn't find his gods. And he came out of Leah's tent n went into Rachel's tent.
Ge 31:34	Now Rachel had taken da idols n put them in da saddle bag of da camel n sat on them. And Jake searched da whole tent thoroughly but didn't find them.
Ge 31:35	And she said 2 her dad, "Let there not be anger in da eyes of my lord, cuz i ain’t able 2 rise b4 u, 4 da wae of women is w me. And he searched carefully n didn't find da idols.
Ge 31:36	Then Jake became angry n quarreled w Laban. Jake answered n said 2 Laban, "Wut is my offense? Wut is my sin dat u pursued after me?
Ge 31:37	Cuz u hav searched all my possessions n wut did u find among all da possessions of my household? Set it b4 my kinsmen n yo kinsmen dat they may decide between da 2 of us!
Ge 31:38	Deez 20 yrs i wuz w u; yo ewes n yo female goats didn't miscarry, n da rams of yo flocks i didn't eat.
Ge 31:39	i brought no mangled carcass 2 u--i bore its loss. From my hand u sought it, whether stolen by day or stolen by night.
Ge 31:40	There i wuz, during da day da heat consumed me, n da cold by night, n my sleep fled from my eyes.
Ge 31:41	Deez 20 yrs i’ve been in yo house. i served u 14 yrs 4 yo 2 daughters n 6 yrs 4 yo flock, n u hav changed my wages 10 times.
Ge 31:42	If da God of my dad, da God of Abe n da Fear of Isaac hadn't been w me, indeed now u would’ve sent me away empty-handed. God saw my misery n da labor of my hands n roasted u last night."
Ge 31:43	Then Laban answered n said 2 Jake, "Da daughters r my daughters n da grandsons r my grandsons, n da flocks r my flocks, n all dat u c, it’s mine. Now, wut can i do 4 deez my daughters 2day, or 4 their kids whom they hav borne?
Ge 31:44	So now, come, let’s make a covenant, u n i, n let it be a witness between me n u."
Ge 31:45	And Jake took a stone n set it up as a stone pillar.
Ge 31:46	And Jake said 2 his kinsmen, "Gather stones." And they took stones n made a pile of stones, n they ate there by da pile of stones.
Ge 31:47	And Laban called it Jegar Sahadutha, but Jake called it Galeed.
Ge 31:48	Then Laban said, "Dis pile of stones is a witness between me n u 2day." So its name is called Galeed,
Ge 31:49	n Mizpah, cuz he said, "YHWH watch between me n u when we're out of sight of each other.
Ge 31:50	If u mistreat my daughters, n if u take wives besides my daughters, when there’s no man w us, c--God is a witness between me n u."
Ge 31:51	And Laban said 2 Jake, "C, dis pile of stones, n c da pillar dat i’ve set up between me n u.
Ge 31:52	Dis pile of stones is a witness, n da pillar is a witness, dat i’ll not pass beyond dis pile of stones 2 u, n dat u won’t pass beyond dis pile of stones n dis pillar 2 me intending harm.
Ge 31:53	May da God of Abe n da God of Nahor, da God of their dad judge between us." Then Jake swore by da Fear of his dad Isaac.
Ge 31:54	And Jake sacrificed a sacrifice on da hill, n he called his kinsmen 2 eat da meal. And they ate da meal n spent da night on da hill.
Ge 31:55	 And Laban arose early in da mornin’ n kissed his grandsons n his daughters, n blessed them. Then Laban departed n returned 2 his homeland. 


CHAPTER 32
Ge 32:1	And Jake went on his wey, n angels of God met him.
Ge 32:2	And when he saw them, Jake said, "Dis is da camp of God!" And he called da name of dat place Mahanaim. 

Ge 32:3	Then Jake sent messengers b4 him 2 Esau his bro, 2 da land of Seir, da territory of Edom.
Ge 32:4	And he instructed them, sayin’, "So u must tell my lord, 2 Esau, 'So says yo servant Jake, i’ve dwelled as an alien w Laban, n i’ve remained there until now.
Ge 32:5	And i’ve acquired cattle, male donkeys, flocks, n male n female slaves, n i’ve sent 2 tell my lord, 2 find favor in yo eyes.'"
Ge 32:6	And da messengers returned 2 Jake n said, "We came 2 yo bro, 2 Esau, n he’s comin’ 2 meet u, n 4 hundred men r w him."
Ge 32:7	Then Jake wuz frightened af n distressed. So he divided da ppl, flocks, cattle, n camels dat were w him into 2 companies.
Ge 32:8	And he thought, "If Esau comes 2 1 company n destroys it, da remaining company gonna be able 2 escape."
Ge 32:9	Then Jake said, "O God of my dad Abe, n God of my dad Isaac, O YHWH, who said 2 me, 'Return 2 yo land n 2 yo fam, n i’ll deal well w u.'
Ge 32:10	i ain’t worthy of all da loyal luv n all da faithfulness dat u hav shown yo servant, 4 w only my staff i crossed dis Jordan, n now i’ve become 2 camps.
Ge 32:11	Please rescue me from da hand of my bro, from da hand of Esau, cuz i fear him, lest he come n attacc mom n kids alike.
Ge 32:12	Now u yoself said, 'i’ll ofc deal well w u n make yo offspring as da sand of da sea dat can’t be counted 4 abundance.'" 

Ge 32:13	And he lodged there dat night. Then he took from wut he had w him a gift 4 Esau his bro:
Ge 32:14	2 hundred female goats, 20 male goats, 2 hundred ewes, 20 rams,
Ge 32:15	thirty milk camels w their yung, forty cows, 10 bulls, 20 female donkeys, n 10 male donkeys.
Ge 32:16	And he put them under da hand of his servants, herd by herd, n said 2 his servants, "Cross on ahead b4 me, n put some distance between herds.
Ge 32:17	And he instructed da foremost, sayin’, "When Esau my bro comes on u n asks u, sayin’, 'Whose r u n where r u goin’? 2 whom do deez animals belong ahead of u?'
Ge 32:18	Then u must say, '2 yo servant, 2 Jake. It’s a gift sent 2 my lord, 2 Esau. Now look, he’s also comin’ after us.'"
Ge 32:19	And he also instructed da 2nd servant n da 3rd, n e’erybody else who wuz behind da herds, sayin’, "U must talk 2 Esau accordin’ 2 dis word when u find him.
Ge 32:20	And moreover, u will say, 'Look, yo servant Jake is behind us.'" Cuz he thought, "Let me appease him w da gift goin’ b4 me, n afterward i’ll c his face. Maybe he’ll show me favor."
Ge 32:21	So da gift passed on b4 him, but he himself spent dat night in da camp. 

Ge 32:22	Dat night he arose n took his 2 wives, his 2 female servants, n his 11 kids n crossed da ford of da Jabbok.
Ge 32:23	And he took them n sent them across da stream. Then he sent across all his possessions.
Ge 32:24	And Jake remained alone, n a man wrestled w him until da breaking of da dawn.
Ge 32:25	And when he saw dat he couldn't prevail against him, he struck his hip socket, so dat Jake's hip socket wuz sprained as he wrestled w him.
Ge 32:26	Then he said, "Let me go, 4 dawn is breaking." But he answered, "i’ll not let u go unless u bless me."
Ge 32:27	Then he said 2 him, "Wut is yo name?" And he said, "Jake."
Ge 32:28	And he said, "Yo name will no longer be called Jake, but Israel, 4 u hav struggled w God n w men n hav prevailed."
Ge 32:29	Then Jake asked n said, "Please tell me yo name." And he said, "Y do u ask dis--4 my name?" And he blessed him there.
Ge 32:30	Then Jake called da name of da place Peniel which means "i’ve seen God face 2 face n my lyf wuz spared."
Ge 32:31	Then da sun rose on him as he passed Penuel, n he wuz limping cuz of his hip.
Ge 32:32	So da Israelites don’t eat da sinew of da sciatic nerve dat’s on da socket of da hip unto dis day, cuz he struck da socket of da thigh of Jake at da sinew of da sciatic nerve. 


CHAPTER 33
Ge 33:1	And Jake lifted up his eyes n looked. And look, Esau wuz comin’ n 4 hundred men were w him. And he divided da kids among Leah n among Rachel, n among da 2 of his female servants.
Ge 33:2	And he put da female slaves n their kids 1st, then Leah n her kids next, then Rachel w Joey last.
Ge 33:3	And he himself passed on b4 them n bowed down 2 da ground 7 times until he came 2 his bro.
Ge 33:4	But Esau ran 2 meet him, n embraced him, n fell on his neck n kissed him, n they cried.
Ge 33:5	Then Esau lifted up his eyes n saw da women n da kids n said, "Who r deez w u?" And he said, "Da kids whom God haz graciously given yo servant."
Ge 33:6	Then da female servants drew near, they n their kids, n they bowed down.
Ge 33:7	Then Leah n her kids drew near n bowed down, n afterward Joey n Rachel drew near n they bowed down.
Ge 33:8	And he said, "Wut do u mean by all dis company dat i’ve met?" Then he said, "2 find favor in da eyes of my lord."
Ge 33:9	Then Esau said, "i’ve enough my bro; keep wut u hav."
Ge 33:10	And Jake said, "No, please, if i’ve found favor in yo eyes, u must take my gift from my hand, 4 then i’ve seen yo face which is like seeing da face of God, n u hav received me.
Ge 33:11	Please take my gift which haz been brought 2 u, 4 God haz dealt graciously w me, n cuz i’ve enough." And he urged him, so he took it.
Ge 33:12	Then he said, "Let us journey n go on, n i’ll go ahead of u."
Ge 33:13	But he said 2 him, "My lord knows dat da kids r frail, n da flocks n da cattle which r nursing r a concern 2 me. Now if they drove them hard 4 a day all da flocks would die.
Ge 33:14	Let my lord pass on b4 his servant n i’ll move along slowly at da pace of da livestock dat r ahead of me, n at da pace of da kids until i come 2 my lord in Seir."
Ge 33:15	And Esau said, "Let me leave some of my ppl w u." But he said, "Wut need is there? Let me find favor in da eyes of my lord."
Ge 33:16	So Esau turned dat day on his wae 2 Seir.
Ge 33:17	But Jake traveled on 2 Succoth, n he built 4 himself a house, n he made shelters 4 his livestock. So he called da name of da place Succoth.
Ge 33:18	And Jake came safely 2 da city of Shechem which is in da land of Canaan, on his wae from Paddan-Aram. And he camped b4 da city.
Ge 33:19	And he bought a piece of land where he pitched his tent 4 1 hundred pieces of money from da hand of da sons of Hamor, dad of Shechem.
Ge 33:20	And there he erected an altar n called it "El Elohe Israel." 


CHAPTER 34
Ge 34:1	Now Dinah da daughter of Leah, whom she had borne 2 Jake, went out 2 c da daughters of da land.
Ge 34:2	And Shechem, da son of Hamor da Hivite, da prince of da land, saw her. And he took her n lay w her n raped her.
Ge 34:3	And his soul clung 2 Dinah, da daughter of Jake, n he luvd da girl n spoke tenderly 2 da girl.
Ge 34:4	So Shechem said 2 Hamor his dad, sayin’, "Get dis girl 4 me as a wife." 

Ge 34:5	And Jake heard dat Dinah his daughter had been defiled, but his sons were w his flocks in da field. And Jake kept silent until they came.
Ge 34:6	And Hamor, dad of Shechem, went out 2 Jake 2 talk w him.
Ge 34:7	And da sons of Jake came in from da field when they heard it. And da men were distressed n angry af cuz he had done a disgraceful thang in Israel by having sexy times w da daughter of Jake--somethin’ dat shouldn’t be done.
Ge 34:8	And Hamor spoke w them sayin’, "Shechem my son is in luv w yo daughter. Please give her 2 him 4 a wife.
Ge 34:9	Make marriages w us. Give us yo daughters n take our daughters 4 yoselves.
Ge 34:10	U will dwell w us n da land will be b4 u; settle n trade in it, n acquire property in it."
Ge 34:11	Then Shechem said 2 her dad n 2 her bros, "Let me find favor in yo eyes, n whatever u tell me i’ll do.
Ge 34:12	Make da bride price n gift as high as u like; i’ll give wut u tell me. But gimme da girl as a wife."
Ge 34:13	Then da sons of Jake answered Shechem n his dad Hamor talkin’ deceitfully, cuz he had defiled Dinah their sister.
Ge 34:14	And they said 2 them, "We can’t do dis thang, 2 give our sister 2 a man who is uncircumcised, 4 dat’s a disgrace 4 us.
Ge 34:15	Only on dis condition will we give consent 2 u; if u will become like us--every male among u 2 be cut.
Ge 34:16	Then we'll give our daughters 2 u, n we'll take 4 ourselves yo daughters, n we'll live w u n become 1 fam.
Ge 34:17	But if u won’t listen 2 us, 2 be cut, then we'll take our daughters n we'll go."
Ge 34:18	And their words were gud in da eyes of Hamor n in da eyes of Shechem, da son of Hamor.
Ge 34:19	And da yung man didn't delay 2 do da thang, 4 he wanted da daughter of Jake. Now he wuz da most honored of his dad's house.
Ge 34:20	Then Hamor n his son Shechem came 2 da gate of their city, n they spoke 2 da men of their city, sayin’,
Ge 34:21	"Deez men r at pce w us. Let them dwell in da land n let them trade in it. Now, look, da land is broad enough 4 them. Let us take their daughters as wives, n let’s give our daughters 2 them.
Ge 34:22	Only on dis condition will they give consent 2 us, 2 live w us n 2 become 1 fam--when every male among us is cut as they’re cut.
Ge 34:23	Will not their livestock n their property n all their animals be ours? Only let’s give consent 2 them so they’ll live among us."
Ge 34:24	And all those who went out of da gate of his city listened 2 Hamor n Shechem. Every male wuz cut, all those who went out of da gate of his city.
Ge 34:25	And it happened dat on da 3rd day, while they were in pain, 2 of da sons of Jake, Simeon n Levi, da bros of Dinah, each took his sword n came against da unsuspecting city n killed all da males.
Ge 34:26	They killed Hamor n his son Shechem w da edge of da sword, n they took Dinah from da house of Shechem n went out.
Ge 34:27	Da other sons of Jake came on da slain n plundered da city, cuz they had defiled their sister.
Ge 34:28	They took their flocks n their cattle n their donkeys, n whatever wuz in da field.
Ge 34:29	They captured n plundered all dat wuz in da houses--all their wealth, their lil’ ones, n their women.
Ge 34:30	Then Jake said 2 Simeon n Levi, "U hav brought trouble on me, making me stink among da ppl of da land, among da Canaanites n da Perizzites! im few in numba! If they gather against me n attacc me, i gonna be destroyed--i n my household!"
Ge 34:31	But they said, "Will he treat our sister like a hoe?" 


CHAPTER 35
Ge 35:1	And God said 2 Jake, "Arise, go up 2 Bethel n dwell there, n make an altar 2 da God who appeared 2 u when u fled from b4 Esau yo bro."
Ge 35:2	Then Jake said 2 his household n 2 all who were w him, "Get rid of da foreign gods dat r in yo midst n purify yoselves n change yo garments.
Ge 35:3	Then let’s make ready n let’s go up 2 Bethel, so dat i can make an altar there 2 da God who answered me in da day of my trouble, n who haz been w me on da wey dat i’ve gone."
Ge 35:4	So they gave 2 Jake all da foreign gods dat were in their hands, n da ornamental rings dat were in their ears. And Jake buried them under da oak which wuz near Shechem.
Ge 35:5	Then they set out on their journey, n da terror of God wuz on da cities dat were all around them, so dat they didn't pursue after da sons of Jake.
Ge 35:6	And Jake came 2 Luz which wuz in da land of Canaan (dat’s Bethel), he n all da ppl dat were w him.
Ge 35:7	And he built an altar there n called da place El-Bethel, 4 there God had appeared 2 him when he fled b4 his bro.
Ge 35:8	And Deborah, da nurse of Rebekah, died. And she wuz buried below Bethel, under da oak. And its name wuz called Allon-Bacuth.
Ge 35:9	And God appeared 2 Jake again when he came from Paddan-Aram, n he blessed him.
Ge 35:10	And God said 2 him, "Yo name is Jake. Yo name will no longer be called Jake, but Israel will be yo name." Then his name wuz called Israel.
Ge 35:11	And God said 2 him, "im El-Shaddai. Be fruitful n multiply. A nation n an assemblage of nations will be from u, n kings will go out from yo loins.
Ge 35:12	And as 4 da land dat i gave 2 Abe n 2 Isaac, i’ll give it 2 u. And 2 yo descendants after u i’ll give da land.
Ge 35:13	And God went up from him at da place where he spoke w him.
Ge 35:14	And Jake set up a pillar at da place where God had spoken w him, a pillar of stone. And he poured out a drink offering on it, n poured oil on it.
Ge 35:15	And Jake called da name of da place where God had spoken w him Bethel. 

Ge 35:16	Then they journeyed from Bethel. And when they were still some distance from Ephrath, Rachel went into labor. And she had hard labor.
Ge 35:17	And when her labor wuz da most difficult da midwife said 2 her, "Don’t be afraid 4 u hav anotha son."
Ge 35:18	And it happened dat when her lyf wuz departing (4 she wuz dying), she called his name Ben-Oni. But his dad called him Ben.
Ge 35:19	And Rachel died n she wuz buried on da wey 2 Ephrath (dat’s, Bethlehem).
Ge 35:20	And Jake erected a pillar at her burial site. Dat is da pillar of da burial site of Rachel unto dis day.
Ge 35:21	And Israel journeyed on n pitched his tent beyond da tower of Eder.
Ge 35:22	And while Israel wuz livin’ in dat land Reuben went n had sexy times w Bilhah, his dad's concubine. And Israel heard 'bout it. 

Ge 35:23	Da sons of Leah: Da firstborn of Jake wuz Reuben. Then Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, n Zebulun.

Ge 37:2	Deez r da gens of Jake. Joey, bein’ 17 yrs old, wuz shepherding da flock w his bros. Now he wuz a helper w da sons of Bilhah n da sons of Zilpah, da wives of his dad. And Joey brought a bad report of them 2 his dad.
Ge 37:3	Now Israel luvd Joey more than all his sons, 4 he wuz a son of his old age. And he made a robe w long sleeves 4 him.
Ge 37:4	When his bros saw dat their dad luvd him more than all his bros, they hated him n weren't able 2 talk peaceably 2 him. 

Ge 37:5	And Joey dreamed a dream, n he told it 2 his bros. And they hated him even more.
Ge 37:6	And he said 2 them, "Listen now 2 dis dream dat i dreamed.
Ge 37:7	Now look, we were binding sheaves in da midst of da field n, look, my sheaf stood up n it remained standing. Then look, yo sheaves gathered around n bowed down 2 my sheaf."
Ge 37:8	Then his bros said 2 him, "Will u rly rule over us?" And they hated him even more on account of his dream n cuz of his words.
Ge 37:9	Then he dreamed yet anotha dream n told it 2 his bros. And he said, "Look, i dreamed a dream again, n look, da sun n da moon n 11 stars were bowing down 2 me."
Ge 37:10	And he told it 2 his dad n 2 his bros. And his dad roasted him n said 2 him, "Wut is dis dream dat u hav dreamed? Will i n yo mom n yo bros indeed come 2 bow down 2 da ground 2 u?"
Ge 37:11	And his bros were jealous of him, but his dad kept da matter in mind. 

Ge 37:12	Now his bros went 2 pasture da flock of their dad in Shechem.
Ge 37:13	And Israel said 2 Joey, "R not yo bros pasturing in Shechem? Come, let me send u 2 them." And he said, "Here im."
Ge 37:14	Then he said 2 him, "Go now, c if it goes well 4 yo bros n 4 da flock, then return word 2 me." And he sent him from da valley of Hebron, n he arrived at Shechem.
Ge 37:15	And a man found him, n look, he wuz wandering 'bout in a field. And da man asked him, "Wut do u seek?"
Ge 37:16	And he said, "im seeking my bros. Tell me, please, where they’re pasturing."
Ge 37:17	And da man said, "They hav moved on from here, cuz i heard them sayin’, 'Let us go 2 Dothan.'" Then Joey went after his bros n found them in Dothan.
Ge 37:18	And they saw him from a distance. And b4 he drew near 2 them, they conspired against him 2 kill him.
Ge 37:19	And each said 2 his bros, "Look, dis master of dreams is comin’.
Ge 37:20	Now then, come, let’s kill him n yeet him in 1 of da pits. Then we'll say a wild animal devoured him. Then we'll c wut his dreams become."
Ge 37:21	And Reuben heard it n delivered him from their hand n said, "We must not take his lyf."
Ge 37:22	And Reuben said 2 them, "U must not shed blood. Yeet him into dis pit dat’s in da desert, but don’t lay a hand on him"--so dat he might rescue him from their hand 2 return him 2 his dad.

Ge 37:24	And they took him n yote him into da pit (da pit wuz empty; there wuz no water in it).
Ge 37:25	Then they sat down 2 eat some food. And they lifted up their eyes n looked, n look, a caravan of Ishmaelites wuz comin’ from Gilead. And their camels were carrying aromatic gum n balm n spices on da wey 2 Egypt.
Ge 37:26	Then Judah said 2 his bros, "Wut profit is there if we kill our bro n conceal his blood?
Ge 37:27	Come, let’s sell him 2 da Ishmaelites, but our hand will not be against him, 4 he’s our bro, our own flesh." And his bros agreed.
Ge 37:28	Then Midianite traders passed by. And they drew Joey up n brought him up from da pit, n they sold Joey 2 da Ishmaelites 4 20 pieces of silver. And they brought Joey 2 Egypt.
Ge 37:29	Then Reuben returned 2 da pit n, look, Joey wasn’t in da pit. And he tore his clothes.
Ge 37:30	And he returned 2 his bros n said, "Da boi is gone! Now i, wut can i do?"
Ge 37:31	Then they took da robe of Joey n slaughtered a goat, n dipped da robe in da blood.
Ge 37:32	Then they sent da robe w long sleeves n they brought it 2 their dad n said, "We found dis; please examine it. Is it da robe of yo son or not?"
Ge 37:33	And he recognized it n said, "Da robe of my son! A wild animal haz devoured him! Joey is ofc torn 2 pieces!"
Ge 37:34	And Jake tore his clothes n put sackcloth on his loins n mourned 4 his son many days.
Ge 37:35	And all his sons n daughters tried 2 console him, but he refused 2 be consoled. And he said, "No, i’ll go down 2 my son, 2 Sheol, mourning." And his dad cried 4 him.
Ge 37:36	And da Midianites sold him in Egypt 2 Potiphar, a court official of Pharaoh, a commander of da imperial guard. 


CHAPTER 38
Ge 38:1	And it happened dat at dat time Judah went down from his bros n pitched his tent near a certain Adullamite, whose name wuz Hirah.
Ge 38:2	And Judah saw da daughter of a certain Canaanite there whose name wuz Shua. And he took her n went in 2 her.
Ge 38:3	And she conceived n bore a son, n he called his name Er.
Ge 38:4	And she conceived again n bore a son, n he called his name Onan.
Ge 38:5	And once again she bore a son, n she called his name Shelah. And he wuz in Chezib when she bore him.
Ge 38:6	And Judah took a wife 4 Er his firstborn, n her name wuz Tamar.
Ge 38:7	And Er, da firstborn of Judah, wuz bad in da eyes of YHWH, n YHWH killed him.
Ge 38:8	Then Judah said 2 Onan, "Go in 2 da wife of yo bro n perform da duty of a bro-in-law 2 her, n raise up offspring 4 yo bro."
Ge 38:9	But Onan knew dat da offspring would not be 4 him, so whenever he went in 2 da wife of his bro he’d waste it on da ground so as not 2 give offspring 2 his bro.
Ge 38:10	And wut he did wuz bad in da sight of YHWH, so he killed him also.
Ge 38:11	Then Judah said 2 Tamar, his daughter-in-law, "Stay a widow in yo dad's house until Shelah my son grows up," 4 he feared he’d also die like his bro. So Tamar went n stayed in da house of her dad.
Ge 38:12	And in da course of time da daughter of Shua, da wife of Judah, died. When Judah wuz consoled he went up 2 his sheepshearers, he n his friend Hirah da Adullamite, 2 Timnah.
Ge 38:13	And 'twas told 2 Tamar, sayin’, "Look, yo dad-in-law is goin’ up 2 Timnah 2 shear his sheep."
Ge 38:14	So she removed da clothes of her widowhood n covered herself w da veil n disguised herself. And she sat at da entrance 2 Eynayim, which is on da wey 2 Timnah, 4 she saw dat Shelah wuz grown but she hadn't been given 2 him as a wife.
Ge 38:15	And Judah saw her n reckoned her 2 be a hoe, 4 she had covered her face.
Ge 38:16	And he turned aside 2 her at da roadside n said, "Please come, let me come in 2 u," 4 he didn't kno dat she wuz his daughter-in-law. And she said, "Wut will u give 2 me dat u may come in 2 me?"
Ge 38:17	And he said, "i’ll send a kid from da goats of da flock." And she said, "Only if u give a pledge until u send it."
Ge 38:18	And he said, "Wut is da pledge dat i must give 2 u?" And she said, "yo seal, yo cord, n yo staff dat’s in yo hand." And he gave them 2 her n went in 2 her. And she conceived by him.
Ge 38:19	And she arose n left, n she removed her veil from herself n put on da garments of her widowhood.
Ge 38:20	And Judah sent da kid from da goats by da hand of his friend da Adullamite 2 take back da pledge from da hand of da woman, but he couldn't find her.
Ge 38:21	So he asked da men of her place, sayin’, "Where is dat cult hoe dat wuz at Eynayim by da roadside?" And they said, "There is no cult hoe here."
Ge 38:22	Then he returned 2 Judah n said, "i couldn't find her. Morever, da men of da place said, 'There is no cult hoe here.'"
Ge 38:23	And Judah said, "Let her take them 4 herself, lest we be LOLed at. Look, i sent dis kid, but u couldn't find her."
Ge 38:24	And 'bout 3 months later 'twas told 2 Judah, "Tamar yo daughter-in-law haz played da whore, n now, look, she’s conceived by prostitution." And Judah said, "Bring her out n let her be burned."
Ge 38:25	She wuz brought out, but she sent 2 her dad-in-law sayin’, "By da man 2 whom deez belong i’ve conceived." And she said, "Now discern 2 whom deez belong: da seal n cord n da staff."
Ge 38:26	Then Judah recognized them n said, "She is more gud than i, since i didn't give her 2 my son Shelah." And he didn't kno her again.
Ge 38:27	And it happened dat at da time she gave birth dat, look, twins were in her womb.
Ge 38:28	And it happened dat at her labor 1 kid put out a hand. And da midwife took it n tied a crimson thread on his hand sayin’, "Dis 1 came out 1st."
Ge 38:29	Then his hand drew back n, look, his bro came out, n she said, "Wut a breach u hav made 4 yoself!" And she called his name Perez.
Ge 38:30	And afterward his bro who had da crimson thread on his hand came out. And his name wuz called Zerah. 


CHAPTER 39
Ge 39:1	Now Joey had been brought down 2 Egypt, n Potiphar, a court official of Pharaoh, commander of da guard, an Egyptian, bought him from da hand of da Ishmaelites who had brought him down there.
Ge 39:2	And YHWH wuz w Joey, n he became a successful man. And he wuz in da house of his master, da Egyptian.
Ge 39:3	And his master observed dat YHWH wuz w him, n everythin’ dat wuz in his hand 2 do YHWH made successful.
Ge 39:4	And Joey found favor in his eyes n he served him. Then he appointed him over his house n all dat he owned he put into his hand.
Ge 39:5	And it happened dat from da time he appointed him over his house n over all dat he had, YHWH blessed da house of da Egyptian on account of Joey. And da blessing of YHWH wuz on all dat he had in da house n in da field.
Ge 39:6	And he left all dat he had in da hand of Joey, n he didn't woz 'bout anythin’ except da food dat he ate. Now Joey wuz well built n handsome.
Ge 39:7	And it happened dat after deez tingz his master's wife cast her eyes on Joey, n she said, "Lie w me."
Ge 39:8	But he refused n said 2 his master's wife, "Look, my master doesn't woz 'bout wut is in da house, n everythin’ he owns he’s put in my hand.
Ge 39:9	He haz no better authority in dis house than me, n he hasn't withheld anythin’ from me except u, since u r his wife. Now how could i do dis great wickedness n sin against God?"
Ge 39:10	And it happened dat as she spoke 2 Joey day after day, he didn't heed her 2 lie beside her or 2 be w her.
Ge 39:11	But 1 particular day he came into da house 2 do his work n none of da men of da house were there in da house,
Ge 39:12	she seized him by his garment n said, "Lie w me!" And he left his garment in her hand n fled, n he went outside.
Ge 39:13	And it happened dat when she saw dat he left his garment in her hand n fled outside,
Ge 39:14	she called 2 da men of her house n said 2 them, "Look! He brought a Hebrew man 2 us 2 roast us! He came 2 me 2 lie w me, n i cried out w a loud voice.
Ge 39:15	And when he heard me, dat i raised my voice n called out, he left his garment beside me n fled, n he went outside."
Ge 39:16	Then she put his garment beside her until his master came 2 his house.
Ge 39:17	Then she spoke 2 him accordin’ 2 deez words, sayin’, "Da Hebrew slave dat u brought 2 us came 2 me 2 make fun of me.
Ge 39:18	And it happened dat as i raised my voice n called out, he left his garment beside me n fled outside."
Ge 39:19	And when his master heard da words of his wife dat she spoke 2 him, "Dis is wut yo servant did 2 me," he became angry af.
Ge 39:20	And Joey's master took him n put him into jail, da place dat da king's prisoners were confined. And he wuz there in jail.
Ge 39:21	And YHWH wuz w Joey, n showed loyal luv 2 him, n gave him favor in da eyes of da chief of da prison.
Ge 39:22	And da chief of da prison put all da prisoners dat were in da jail into da hand of Joey. And everythin’ dat wuz done there, he wuz da 1 who did it.
Ge 39:23	Da chief of da prison didn't woz 'bout anythin’ in his hand, since YHWH wuz w him. And whatever he did YHWH made it successful. 


CHAPTER 40
Ge 40:1	And it happened dat after deez tingz da cupbearer of da king of Egypt n his baker did wrong against their lord, against da king of Egypt.
Ge 40:2	And Pharaoh wuz angry w his 2 officials, w da chief cupbearer n chief baker.
Ge 40:3	And he put them in custody in da house of da chief of da guard, into da prison where Joey wuz confined.
Ge 40:4	And da chief of da guard appointed Joey 2 be w them, n he attended them. And they were in custody many days.
Ge 40:5	And da 2 of them, da cupbearer n da baker of da king of Egypt, who were confined in da jail, dreamed a dream, each his own dream, w its own interpretation.
Ge 40:6	When Joey came 2 them in da mornin’ he looked at them, n look, they were troubled.
Ge 40:7	And he asked da court officials of Pharaoh dat were w him in da custody of his master's house, "Y r yo faces sad 2day?"
Ge 40:8	And they said 2 him, "We each dreamed a dream, but there’s nobody 2 interpret it." And Joey said 2 them, "Don’t interpretations belong 2 God? Please tell them 2 me."
Ge 40:9	Then da chief cupbearer told his dream 2 Joey, n he said 2 him, "In my dream, now look, there wuz a vine b4 me,
Ge 40:10	n on da vine were 3 branches. And as it budded, its blossoms came up, n its clusters of grapes grew ripe.
Ge 40:11	And da cup of Pharaoh wuz in my hand, n i took da grapes n squeezed them into da cup of Pharaoh. Then i placed da cup into da hand of Pharaoh."
Ge 40:12	Then Joey said 2 him, "Dis is its interpretation: Da 3 branches, they’re 3 days.
Ge 40:13	In 3 days Pharaoh will lift up yo head n will restore u 2 yo office. And u will put da cup of Pharaoh into his hand as wuz formerly da custom, when u were his cupbearer.
Ge 40:14	But remember me when it goes well w u, n please may u show kindness w respeck 2 me, n mention me 2 Pharaoh, n bring me out of dis house.
Ge 40:15	Cuz i wuz ofc kidnapped from da land of da Hebrews, n here also i’ve done nothin’ dat they shud put me in dis pit."
Ge 40:16	And when da chief baker saw dat da interpretation wuz gud he said 2 Joey, "i also dreamed. In my dream, now look, there were 3 baskets of bread on my head.
Ge 40:17	And in da upper basket were all sorts of baked foods 4 Pharaoh, but da birbs were eating them out of da basket on my head."
Ge 40:18	Then Joey answered n said, "Dis is its interpretation: Da 3 baskets, they’re 3 days.
Ge 40:19	In 3 days Pharaoh will lift yo head from u n hang u on a pole, n da birbs will eat yo flesh from u."
Ge 40:20	And it happened dat on da 3rd day, which wuz Pharaoh's birthday, he made a feast 4 all his servants. And he lifted up da head of da chief cupbearer n da head of da chief baker in da midst of his servants.
Ge 40:21	And he restored da chief cupbearer 2 his cupbearing position. And he placed da cup in da hand of Pharaoh.
Ge 40:22	But da chief baker he hanged as Joey had interpreted 2 them.
Ge 40:23	But da chief cupbearer didn't remember Joey, but forgot him. 


CHAPTER 41
Ge 41:1	And it happened dat after 2 full yrs Pharaoh dreamed, n look, he wuz standing by da Nile.
Ge 41:2	And look, 7 cows, well built n fat, were comin’ up from da Nile, n they grazed among da reeds.
Ge 41:3	And look, 7 other cows came up after them from da Nile, ugly n gaunt, n they stood beside those cows on da bank of da Nile.
Ge 41:4	And da ugly n gaunt cows ate da 7 well built n fat cows. Then Pharaoh awoke.
Ge 41:5	And he fell asleep n dreamed a 2nd time, n look, 7 ears of grain, plump n gud, were comin’ out of 1 stalk.
Ge 41:6	And look, 7 thin ears of grain, scorched by da east wind, sprouted up after them.
Ge 41:7	And da thin ears of grain swallowed up da 7 plump n full ears of grain. Then Pharaoh awoke, n look, 'twas a dream.
Ge 41:8	And it happened dat in da mornin’ his spirit wuz troubled, n he sent n called all of da magicians of Egypt, n all its woke men, n Pharaoh told his dream 2 them. But they had no interpretation 4 Pharaoh.
Ge 41:9	Then da chief of da cupbearers spoke w Pharaoh, sayin’, "i remember my sins 2day.
Ge 41:10	Pharaoh wuz angry w his servants, n he put me n da chief baker in da custody of da house of da chief of da guard.
Ge 41:11	And we dreamed a dream 1 night, i n he, each w a dream dat had a meaning.
Ge 41:12	And there w us wuz a yung man, a Hebrew servant of da chief of da guard, n we told him da dream, n he interpreted our dreams 4 us, each accordin’ 2 his dream he interpreted.
Ge 41:13	And it happened just like he interpreted 2 us, so 'twas. He restored me 2 my office, n him he hanged."
Ge 41:14	Then Pharaoh sent n called 4 Joey, n they brought him quickly from da jail. And he shaved n changed his clothing, n came 2 Pharaoh.
Ge 41:15	Then Pharaoh said 2 Joey, "i dreamed a dream, but there’s none 2 interpret it. Now, i’ve heard abt u dat when u hear a dream u can interpret it."
Ge 41:16	Then Joey answered Pharaoh sayin’, "It isn’t in my power; God will answer abt da well-bein’ of Pharaoh."
Ge 41:17	And Pharaoh said 2 Joey, "Now in my dream, look, i wuz standing on da bank of da Nile,
Ge 41:18	n look, 7 cows, well built n fat, were comin’ up from da Nile, n they grazed among da reeds.
Ge 41:19	And look, 7 other cows came up after them from da Nile, very ugly n gaunt--never hav i seen any as them in all da land of Egypt 4 ugliness.
Ge 41:20	And da thin n ugly cows ate da former 7 healthy cows.
Ge 41:21	But when they went into their bellies it couldn't be known dat they went into their bellies, 4 their appearance wuz as ugly as at da beginning. Then i awoke.
Ge 41:22	Then i saw in my dream n look, 7 ears of grain were comin’ out of 1 stalk, full n gud.
Ge 41:23	And look, 7 withered ears of grain, thin n scorched by da east wind, sprouted up after them.
Ge 41:24	And da thin ears of grain swallowed up da 7 gud ears of grain. And i told da magicians, but there wuz none 2 explain it 2 me."
Ge 41:25	Then Joey said 2 Pharaoh, "Da dreams of Pharaoh r 1. God haz revealed 2 Pharaoh wut he’s 'bout 2 do.
Ge 41:26	Da 7 gud cows, they’re 7 yrs, n da 7 gud ears of grain, they’re 7 yrs. Da dreams r 1.
Ge 41:27	And da 7 thin n ugly cows comin’ up after them, they’re 7 yrs, n da 7 empty ears of grain, scorched by da east wind, they’re also 7 yrs of famine.
Ge 41:28	Dis is da word dat i’ve spoken 2 Pharaoh; God haz shown Pharaoh wut he’s 'bout 2 do.
Ge 41:29	Look, 7 yrs of great abundance r comin’ throughout da whole land of Egypt.
Ge 41:30	Then 7 yrs of famine will arise after them, n all da abundance in da land of Egypt gonna be forgotten. Da famine will consume da land.
Ge 41:31	Abundance in da land won’t be known cuz of da famine dat follows, 4 it gonna be heavy af.
Ge 41:32	Now abt da repetition of da dream twice 2 Pharaoh, it’s cuz da matter is established by God, n God will do it quickly.
Ge 41:33	Now then, let Pharaoh select a man who is discerning n woke, n let him set him over da land of Egypt.
Ge 41:34	Let Pharaoh do dis, n let him appoint supervisors over da land, n let him take 1-5th from da land of Egypt in da 7 yrs of abundance.
Ge 41:35	Then let them gather all da food of deez comin’ gud yrs n let them pile up grain under da hand of Pharaoh 4 food in da cities, n let them keep it.
Ge 41:36	Then da food will be as a deposit 4 da land 4 da 7 yrs of da famine dat gonna be in da land of Egypt, dat da land won’t die on account of da famine." 

Ge 41:37	And da plan wuz gud in da eyes of Pharaoh n in da eyes of all his servants.
Ge 41:38	Then Pharaoh said 2 his servants, "Can we find a man like dis in whom is da spirit of God?"
Ge 41:39	Then Pharaoh said 2 Joey, "Since God haz made all of dis known 2 u there’s nobody as discerning n woke as u.
Ge 41:40	U will be over my house, n 2 yo word all my ppl will submit. Only w respeck 2 da throne will i be better than u."
Ge 41:41	Then Pharaoh said 2 Joey, "C, i’ve set u over all da land of Egypt."
Ge 41:42	Then Pharaoh removed his signet ring from his finger n put it on da finger of Joey. And he clothed him w garments of fine linen, n he put a chain of gold around his neck.
Ge 41:43	And he had him ride in his 2nd chariot. And they cried out b4 him, "Kneel!" And Pharaoh set him over all da land of Egypt.
Ge 41:44	Then Pharaoh said 2 Joey, "im Pharaoh, but without yo consent nobody will lift his hand or his foot in all da land of Egypt."
Ge 41:45	And Pharaoh called da name of Joey Zaphenath-paneah n gave him Asenath, da daughter of Potiphera, priest of On, as a wife. And Joey went out over da land of Egypt.
Ge 41:46	Now Joey wuz thirty yrs old when he stood b4 Pharaoh, da king of Egypt. And Joey went out from da presence of Pharaoh n traveled thru da whole land of Egypt.
Ge 41:47	And da land produced a plenty in da 7 yrs of abundance.
Ge 41:48	And he gathered all da food of da 7 yrs which occurred in da land of Egypt. And he stored da food in da cities. Da food of da field dat surrounded each city he stored in its midst.
Ge 41:49	And Joey piled up grain like da sand of da sea in great abundance until he stopped counting it, 4 it couldn't be counted.
Ge 41:50	B4 da yrs of famine came, Asenath, daughter of Potiphera priest of On, bore 2 sons 2 him.
Ge 41:51	And Joey called da name of da firstborn Manasseh, 4 he said, "God haz caused me 2 forget all my hardship n all my dad's house."
Ge 41:52	And da name of da 2nd he called Ephraim, 4 he said, "God haz made me fruitful in da land of my misfortune."
Ge 41:53	And da 7 yrs of abundance which were in da land of Egypt came 2 an end.
Ge 41:54	And da 7 yrs of famine began 2 come as Joey had said. And there wuz famine in all of da countries, but in da land of Egypt there wuz food.
Ge 41:55	And when all da land of Egypt wuz hungry da ppl cried out 2 Pharaoh 4 food. And Pharaoh said 2 all da land of Egypt, "Go 2 Joey; wut he says 2 u, u must do."
Ge 41:56	And da famine wuz over da whole land, n Joey opened all da storehouses n sold food 2 da Egyptians. And da famine wuz severe in da land of Egypt.
Ge 41:57	And every land came 2 Egypt 2 Joey 2 buy grain, 4 da famine wuz severe in every land. 


CHAPTER 42
Ge 42:1	When Jake realized dat there wuz grain in Egypt, Jake said 2 his sons, "Y do u look at 1 anotha?"
Ge 42:2	Then he said, "Look, i’ve heard dat there’s grain in Egypt. Go down there n buy grain 4 us there dat we may live n not die."
Ge 42:3	And da 10 bros of Joey went down 2 buy grain from Egypt.
Ge 42:4	But Jake didn't send Ben, da bro of Joey, 4 he feared harm would come 2 him.
Ge 42:5	Then da sons of Israel went 2 buy grain amid those other ppl who went as well, 4 there wuz famine in da land of Canaan.
Ge 42:6	Now Joey wuz da governor over da land. He wuz da 1 who sold food 2 all da ppl of da land. And da bros of Joey came n bowed down 2 him w their faces 2 da ground.
Ge 42:7	And Joey saw his bros n recognized them, but he pretended 2 be a stranger 2 them. And he spoke w them harshly n said 2 them, "From where hav u come?" And they said, "From da land of Canaan 2 buy food."
Ge 42:8	And Joey recognized his bros, but they didn't recognize him.
Ge 42:9	And Joey remembered da dreams which he had dreamed abt them, n he said 2 them, "U r spies! U hav come 2 c da nakedness of da land!"
Ge 42:10	And they said 2 him, "No, my lord, but yo servants hav come 2 buy food.
Ge 42:11	We all r sons of 1 man. We r honest men. We, yo servants, aren’t spies."
Ge 42:12	Then he said 2 them, "No, but u hav come 2 c da nakedness of da land."
Ge 42:13	Then they said, "We, yo servants, r 12 bros, da sons of 1 man in da land of Canaan, but look, da youngest is w our dad 2day, n 1 is no more."
Ge 42:14	But Joey said 2 them, "It’s wut i said 2 u--u r spies.
Ge 42:15	By dis u will be tested. By da lyf of Pharaoh u won’t go out from here unless yo youngest bro comes here.
Ge 42:16	Send 1 of u, n let him bring yo bro, but u gonna be kept in prison so dat yo words might be tested 2 c if there’s truth w u. And if not, by da lyf of Pharaoh ofc u r spies."
Ge 42:17	Then he gathered them into da prison 4 3 days.
Ge 42:18	On da 3rd day Joey said 2 them, "Do dis n u will live; i fear God.
Ge 42:19	If u r honest, let 1 of yo bros be kept in prison where u r now bein’ kept, but da rest of u go, carry grain 4 da famine 4 yo households.
Ge 42:20	U must bring yo youngest bro 2 me, n then yo words gonna be confirmed n u won’t die." And they did so.
Ge 42:21	Then each said 2 his bro, "Ofc we're guilty on account of our bro when we saw da anguish of his soul when he pleaded 4 mercy 2 us n we’d not listen. So dis trouble haz come 2 us."
Ge 42:22	Then Reuben answered them, sayin’, "Did i not tell u, don’t sin against da boi? But u didn't listen, n now, look, his blood haz been sought."
Ge 42:23	Now they didn't kno dat Joey understood, 4 da interpreter wuz between them.
Ge 42:24	And he turned away from them n cried. Then he returned 2 them n spoke 2 them, n took Simeon from them n tied him up in front of them.
Ge 42:25	Then Joey gave orders 2 fill their bags w grain n 2 return their money 2 each sack, n 2 give them provisions 4 da journey. So he did 4 them.
Ge 42:26	Then they loaded their grain on their donkeys n went away from there.
Ge 42:27	And 1 of them later opened his sack 2 give fodder 2 his donkey at da lodging place n saw his money--look, 'twas in da mouth of his sack.
Ge 42:28	And he said 2 his bros, "My money wuz returned n moreover, look, it’s in my sack!" Then their hearts failed them n each of them trembled n said, "Wut is dis God haz done 2 us?" 

Ge 42:29	And when they came 2 Jake their dad in da land of Canaan they told him everythin’ dat had happened 2 them, sayin’,
Ge 42:30	"Da man, da lord of da land, spoke harshly 2 us n treated us as if we were spying out da land.
Ge 42:31	But we said 2 him, 'We r honest; we aren’t spies.
Ge 42:32	We r 12 bros, da sons of our dad. 1 is no more n da youngest is w our dad now in da land of Canaan.'
Ge 42:33	Then da man, da lord of da land, said 2 us, 'By dis i’ll kno dat u r honest. Leave 1 bro w me, n take food 4 da famine in yo households n go.
Ge 42:34	And bring yo youngest bro 2 me. Then i’ll kno dat u aren’t spies but u r honest. And i’ll give yo bro back 2 u, n u will trade in da land.'"
Ge 42:35	And it happened dat when they emptied their sacks, look, each 1's pouch of money wuz in his sack. And when they n their dad saw da pouches of their money, they were greatly distressed.
Ge 42:36	And Jake their dad said 2 them, "U hav bereaved me--Joey is no more n Simeon is no more, n Ben u would take! All of dis is against me!
Ge 42:37	Then Reuben said 2 his dad, "U may kill my 2 sons if i don’t bring him back 2 u. Put him in my hand n i myself will return him 2 u."
Ge 42:38	But he said, "My son will not go down w u, 4 his bro is ded n he alone remains. If harm meets him on da journey dat u would take, u would bring down my gray head in sadness 2 Sheol." 


CHAPTER 43
Ge 43:1	Now da famine in da land wuz severe.
Ge 43:2	And it happened dat as they finished eating da grain which they had brought from Egypt their dad said 2 them, "Return n buy a lil’ food 4 us."
Ge 43:3	Then Judah said 2 him, "Da man solemnly admonished us, sayin’, 'U will not c my face unless yo bro is w u.'
Ge 43:4	If u will send our bro w us, we'll go down n buy food 4 u,
Ge 43:5	but if u won’t send him, we'll not go down, 4 da man said 2 us, 'U will not c my face unless yo bro is w u.'"
Ge 43:6	Then Israel said, "Y did u bring trouble 2 me by telling da man u still had a bro?"
Ge 43:7	And they said, "Da man asked explicitly 'bout us n 'bout our fam, sayin’, 'Is yo dad still alive? Do u hav a bro?' And we answered him accordin’ 2 deez words. How could we kno dat he’d say, 'Bring down yo bro'?"
Ge 43:8	Then Judah said 2 his dad Israel, "Send da boi w me, n let’s arise n go, so dat we'll live n not die--u, we, n our kids.
Ge 43:9	i myself gonna be surety 4 him. U may seek him from my hand. If i don’t bring him back 2 u n present him b4 u, then i’ll stand guilty b4 u 4ever.
Ge 43:10	Ofc if we hadn't hesitated by dis time we’d hav returned twice."
Ge 43:11	Then their dad Israel said 2 them, "If it gotta be so then do dis. Take some of da best products of da land in yo bags n take them down 2 da man as a gift--a lil’ balm n honey, aromatic gum n myrrh, n pistachios n almonds.
Ge 43:12	And take double da money in yo hands. Take back da money dat wuz returned in da mouth of yo sacks. Maybe 'twas a mistake.
Ge 43:13	And take yo bro. Now arise n return 2 da man.
Ge 43:14	And may El-Shaddai grant u compassion b4 da man dat he may release yo other bro 2 u n Ben. As 4 me, if im bereaved, im bereaved." 

Ge 43:15	So da men took dis gift, n they took double money in their hands, n Ben, n they rose up n went down 2 Egypt n stood b4 Joey.
Ge 43:16	When Joey saw Ben w them he said 2 da 1 who wuz over his household, "Bring da men into da house n slaughter n prepare an animal, 4 da men will eat w me at noon."
Ge 43:17	And da man did as Joey had said, n da man brought da men into da house of Joey.
Ge 43:18	And da men were afraid when they were brought into da house of Joey. And they said "We were brought here on account of da money dat wuz returned 2 our sacks da 1st time, dat he might attacc us n fall on us 2 take us as slaves w our donkeys."
Ge 43:19	So they approached da man who wuz over Joey's house n spoke 2 him at da doorway of da house.
Ge 43:20	And they said, "Please, my lord, we ofc came down once b4 2 buy food,
Ge 43:21	but when we came 2 da place of lodging n we opened our sacks, then look, each 1's money wuz in da mouth of his sack--our money in its full weight--so we've returned w it in our hands.
Ge 43:22	Now, other money we've brought down in our hand 2 buy food. We dunno who put our money in our sacks."
Ge 43:23	And he said, "Pce 2 u; don’t be afraid. Yo God n da God of yo dad must hav given u a treasure in yo sacks; yo money came 2 me." And he brought Simeon out 2 them.
Ge 43:24	Then da man brought da men into Joey's house n he gave them water n washed their feet, n gave fodder 2 their donkeys.
Ge 43:25	Then they laid out da gift until Joey came at noon, 4 they had heard dat they were 2 eat food there.
Ge 43:26	And when Joey came into da house they brought da gift dat wuz in their hand into da house 2 him, n they bowed down b4 him 2 da ground.
Ge 43:27	And he greeted them n said, "Is yo dad well, da old man of whom u spoke? Is he still alive?"
Ge 43:28	And they said, "Yo servant our dad is well; he’s still alive." And they knelt n bowed down.
Ge 43:29	Then he lifted up his eyes n saw Ben his bro, da son of his mom, n said, "Is dis yo youngest bro of whom u told me?" And he continued, "God be gracious 2 u, my son."
Ge 43:30	Then Joey hurried away, bein’ overcome w emotion toward his bro, n sought 4 a place 2 cri. Then he went into a room n cried there.
Ge 43:31	Then he washed his face n went out, now controlling himself, n said, "Serve da food."
Ge 43:32	And they served him by himself, n them by themselves, n da Egyptians who were eating w him by themselves, 4 Egyptians couldn't dine w Hebrews, cuz dat wuz a detestable thang 2 Egyptians.
Ge 43:33	And they were seated b4 him from da firstborn accordin’ 2 his birthright 2 da youngest accordin’ 2 his youth. And da men looked at 1 anotha amazed.
Ge 43:34	And portions were served 2 them from his table, n da portion of Ben wuz 5 times better than da portion of any of them. And they drank n became drunk w him. 


CHAPTER 44
Ge 44:1	Then he commanded da 1 who wuz over his household, sayin’, "Fill da sacks of da men w food as much as they’re able 2 carry, n put each 1's money in da mouth of his sack.
Ge 44:2	And my cup--da cup of silver--u will put into da mouth of da sack of da youngest, n da money 4 his grain. And he did accordin’ 2 da word of Joey dat he had commanded.
Ge 44:3	When da mornin’ light came da men were sent away, they n their donkeys.
Ge 44:4	They went out of da city, n hadn't gone far when Joey said 2 da 1 who wuz over his house, "Arise! Pursue after da men n overtake them. Then u will tell them, 'Y hav u repaid bad 4 gud?
Ge 44:5	Is dis not dat from which my master drinks? Now he himself totally practices divination w it. U hav done bad in wut u hav done.'"
Ge 44:6	When he overtook them he spoke deez words 2 them.
Ge 44:7	And they said 2 him, "Y haz my lord spoken accordin’ 2 deez words? Far be it from yo servants 2 do such a thang!
Ge 44:8	Look, da money dat we found in da mouth of our sacks we returned 2 u from da land of Canaan. Now y would we steal silver or gold from da house of my lord?
Ge 44:9	Whoever is found w it from among yo servants will die. And moreover, we'll become slaves 2 my lord."
Ge 44:10	Then he said, "Now also accordin’ 2 yo words, so will it be. He who is found w it’ll be my slave, but u will be innocent."
Ge 44:11	Then each man quickly brought down his sack 2 da ground, n each 1 opened his sack.
Ge 44:12	And he searched, beginning w da oldest n finishing w da youngest. And da cup wuz found in da sack of Ben.
Ge 44:13	Then they tore their clothes, n each 1 loaded his donkey n they returned 2 da city. 

Ge 44:14	And Judah n his bros came 2 da house of Joey--now he wuz still there--they fell b4 him 2 da ground.
Ge 44:15	Then Joey said 2 them, "Wut is dis deed dat u hav done? Did u not kno dat a man who is like me ofc practices divination?"
Ge 44:16	And Judah said, "Wut can we tell my lord? Wut can we talk? Now how can we show ourselves innocent? God haz found da guilt of yo servants! Look, we're slaves 2 my lord, both we n also he in whose hand da cup wuz found."
Ge 44:17	But he said, "Far be it from me 2 do dis! Da man in whose hand da cup wuz found, he’ll become my slave. But as 4 u, go up in pce 2 yo dad."
Ge 44:18	But Judah drew near 2 him n said, "Please my lord, let yo servant talk a word in da ears of my lord, n let not yo anger burn against yo servant, 4 u r like Pharaoh himself.
Ge 44:19	My lord had asked his servants, sayin’, 'Do u hav a dad or a bro?'
Ge 44:20	And we said 2 my lord, 'We hav an aged dad, n a younger bro, da kid of his old age, n his bro died, n he alone remains from his mom, n his dad luvs him.'
Ge 44:21	Then u said 2 yo servants, 'Bring him down 2 me dat i may set my eyes on him.'
Ge 44:22	Then we said 2 my lord, 'Da boi can’t leave his dad; if he shud leave his dad, then he’d die.'
Ge 44:23	Then u said 2 yo servants, 'Unless yo youngest bro comes down w u, u will not again c my face.'
Ge 44:24	And it happened dat we went up 2 yo servant, my dad, n told him da words of my lord.
Ge 44:25	And when our dad said, 'Buy a lil’ food 4 us,'
Ge 44:26	then we said, 'We can’t go down. If our youngest bro is w us, then we will go down. Cuz we'll not be able 2 c da face of da man unless our youngest bro is w us.'
Ge 44:27	Then yo servant, my dad, said 2 us, 'U yoselves kno dat my wife bore 2 sons 2 me.
Ge 44:28	1 went out from me, n i said, "Ofc he must hav been torn 2 pieces," n i’ve never seen him since.
Ge 44:29	And if u take dis 1 also from me, n he encounters harm, u will bring down my gray head in sadness 2 Sheol.'
Ge 44:30	So now, when i come 2 yo servant, my dad, n da boi isn’t w us--now his lyf is bound up w his lyf--
Ge 44:31	it’ll happen dat when he sees dat da boi is gone, he’ll die. And yo servants will bring down da gray head of yo servant, our dad, 2 Sheol w sadness.
Ge 44:32	Cuz yo servant is pledged as surety 4 da boi by my dad, sayin’, If i don’t bring him 2 u, then i’ll be culpable 2 my dad 4ever.
Ge 44:33	So then, please let yo servant remain in place of da boi as a slave 2 my lord, n let da boi go up w his bros.
Ge 44:34	Cuz how can i go up 2 my dad if da boi isn’t w me? i don’t wanna c da misery which will find my dad." 


CHAPTER 45
Ge 45:1	Then Joey wasn’t able 2 control himself b4 all who were standing by him. And he cried out, "Make every man go out from me!" So nobody stood w him when Joey made himself known 2 his bros.
Ge 45:2	And he cried loudly, so dat da Egyptians heard it n da household of Pharaoh heard it.
Ge 45:3	Then Joey said 2 his bros, "im Joey! Is my dad still alive?" And his bros were unable 2 answer him, 4 they were dismayed at his presence.
Ge 45:4	So Joey said 2 his bros, "Come near 2 me, please." And they drew near. And he said, "im Joey, yo bro, whom u sold into Egypt.
Ge 45:5	So now, don’t be distressed n don’t be angry w yoselves dat u sold me here, 4 God sent me as deliverance b4 u.
Ge 45:6	Cuz deez 2 yrs da famine haz been in da midst of da land, but there gonna be 5 more yrs where there’s no plowing or harvest.
Ge 45:7	And God sent me b4 u all 2 preserve 4 u a remnant in da land n 2 keep alive among u many survivors.
Ge 45:8	So now, u yoselves didn't send me here, but God put me here as dad 2 Pharaoh n as master of all his household, n a ruler over all da land of Egypt.
Ge 45:9	Hurry, n go up 2 my dad n tell him, 'So says yo son Joey, God haz made me lord of all Egypt. Come down 2 me n don’t delay.
Ge 45:10	U will settle in da land of Goshen so dat u gonna be near me, u n yo kids n yo grandchildren, n yo flocks n yo herds n all dat u hav.
Ge 45:11	And i’ll provide 4 u there, cuz there r still 5 yrs of famine--lest u n yo household n all dat u hav become destitute.'
Ge 45:12	Now look, yo eyes c, n da eyes of my bro Ben c, dat it’s i who am talkin’ 2 u.
Ge 45:13	And u must tell my dad of all my honor in Egypt n all dat u hav seen. Now hurry n bring my dad here."
Ge 45:14	Then he fell on da neck of his bro Ben n cried, n Ben cried on his neck.
Ge 45:15	And he kissed all his bros n cried on them. And afterward his bros spoke w him.
Ge 45:16	Then da report wuz heard in da house of Pharaoh, sayin’, "Joey's bros hav come." And it pleased Pharaoh n his servants.
Ge 45:17	Then Pharaoh said 2 Joey, "Say 2 yo bros: 'Do dis--load yo donkeys n go back 2 da land of Canaan,
Ge 45:18	n take yo dad n yo households n come 2 me, n i’ll give u da best of da land of Egypt, n u will eat da fat of da land.'
Ge 45:19	And u Joey, r commanded 2 say dis: 'Do dis! Take wagons from da land of Egypt 4 yo lil’ ones n yo wives, n bring yo dad n come!
Ge 45:20	Don’t woz 'bout yo possessions, 4 da best of all da land of Egypt is urs.'" 

Ge 45:21	And da sons of Israel did so. And Joey gave them wagons at da word of Pharaoh, n gave them provisions 4 da journey.
Ge 45:22	2 each n 2 all of them he gave sets of clothing, but 2 Ben he gave 3 hundred pieces of silver n 5 sets of clothing.
Ge 45:23	And 2 his dad he sent as follows: 10 donkeys carrying da best of Egypt, n 10 donkeys carrying grain n food n provisions 4 his dad 4 da journey.
Ge 45:24	Then he sent his bros away, n when they departed he said 2 them, "Don’t be agitated on da journey."
Ge 45:25	So they went up from Egypt n came 2 da land of Canaan 2 Jake their dad.
Ge 45:26	And they spoke 2 him, sayin’, "Joey is still alive, n he’s ruler over all da land of Egypt." And his heart went numb, cuz he didn't believe him.
Ge 45:27	Then they told him all da words of Joey dat he had spoken 2 them. And when he saw da wagons dat Joey had sent 2 carry him, then da spirit of Jake their dad revived.
Ge 45:28	And Israel said, "It’s enough. Joey my son is still alive. i’ll go n c him b4 i die." 


CHAPTER 46
Ge 46:1	So Israel journeyed w all dat he had, n he came 2 Beersheba n offered sacrifices 2 da God of his dad, Isaac.
Ge 46:2	And God spoke 2 Israel in visions of da night n said, "Jake, Jake." And he said, "Here im."
Ge 46:3	Then he said, "im da God of yo dad. Don’t be afraid 2 go down 2 Egypt, cuz i’ll make u a great nation there.
Ge 46:4	i myself will go down w u 2 Egypt, n i myself will also bring u up. And Joey will place his hand over yo eyes."
Ge 46:5	So Jake arose from Beersheba. And da sons of Israel carried their dad Jake, n their lil’ ones n their wives in da wagons Pharaoh had sent 2 transport him.
Ge 46:6	And they took their livestock n their possessions dat they had acquired in da land of Canaan. And they came 2 Egypt, Jake n all his offspring w him,
Ge 46:7	his sons n his sons' sons w him, his daughters n his daughters' daughters w him, into Egypt. 

Ge 46:8	Now deez r da names of da sons of Israel, who came into Egypt, Jake n his sons. Reuben, da firstborn of Jake

Ge 46:27	And da sons of Joey who were born 2 him in Egypt were 2 persons. All da persons of da house of Jake who came 2 Egypt were seventy. 

Ge 46:28	He had sent Judah ahead of him 2 Joey 2 appear b4 him in Goshen. And they came 2 da land of Goshen.
Ge 46:29	Then Joey harnessed his chariot n went up 2 meet Israel his dad in Goshen. He presented himself 2 him n fell on his neck n cried on his neck a long time.
Ge 46:30	Then Israel said 2 Joey, "Now let me die since i’ve seen yo face, 4 u r still alive."
Ge 46:31	Then Joey said 2 his bros n 2 his dad's household, "i’ll go up n report 2 Pharaoh, n i’ll tell him, 'My bros n my dad's household who were in da land of Canaan hav come 2 me.
Ge 46:32	And da men r shepherds, 4 they’re men of livestock, n they hav brought their flocks n their cattle n all dat they hav.'
Ge 46:33	And it’ll be dat when Pharaoh calls u he’ll say, 'Wut is yo occupation?'
Ge 46:34	Then u must say, 'U servants r men of livestock from our childhood until now, both we n also our ancestors,' so dat u may dwell in da land of Goshen, 4 every shepherd is a detestable thang 2 Egyptians." 


CHAPTER 47
Ge 47:1	So Joey went n reported 2 Pharaoh. And he said, "My dad n my bros, w their flocks n their herds, n all dat they hav, hav come from da land of Canaan. Now they’re here in da land of Goshen."
Ge 47:2	And from among his bros he took 5 men n presented them b4 Pharaoh.
Ge 47:3	And Pharaoh said 2 his bros, "Wut is yo occupation?" And they said 2 Pharaoh, "Yo servants r keepers of sheep, both we n also our ancestors."
Ge 47:4	And they said 2 Pharaoh, "We hav come 2 sojourn in da land, 4 there’s no pasture 4 yo servant's flocks, 4 da famine is severe in da land of Canaan. So now, please let yo servants dwell in da land of Goshen."
Ge 47:5	Then Pharaoh said 2 Joey, "Yo dad n yo bros hav come 2 u.
Ge 47:6	Da land of Egypt is b4 u. Settle yo dad n yo bros in da best of da land. Let them live in da land of Goshen, n if u kno there’s among them men of ability, then appoint them overseers of my own livestock."
Ge 47:7	Then Joey brought his dad Jake n presented him b4 Pharaoh. And Jake blessed Pharaoh.
Ge 47:8	Then Pharaoh said 2 Jake, "How old r u?"
Ge 47:9	And Jake said 2 Pharaoh, "Da days of da yrs of my sojourning r 1 hundred n thirty yrs. Few n hard hav been da days of da yrs of my lyf, n they haven't reached da days of da yrs of da lives of my ancestors in da days of their sojourning."
Ge 47:10	And Jake blessed Pharaoh, n he went out from da presence of Pharaoh.
Ge 47:11	And Joey settled his dad n his bros, n he gave them property in da land of Egypt in da best part of da land, in da land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had instructed.
Ge 47:12	And Joey provided his dad n his bros n all da household of his dad w food, accordin’ 2 da numba of their kids. 

Ge 47:13	Now there wuz no food in all da land, 4 da famine wuz severe af. And da land of Egypt languished, w da land of Canaan, on account of da famine.
Ge 47:14	And Joey collected all da money found in da land of Egypt n in da land of Canaan in exchange 4 da grain dat they were buying. And Joey brought da money into da house of Pharaoh.
Ge 47:15	And when da money wuz spent in da land of Egypt n from da land of Canaan, all of Egypt came 2 Joey, sayin’, "Give us food! Y shud we die b4 u? Cuz da money is used up."
Ge 47:16	And Joey said, "Give yo livestock n i’ll give u food in exchange 4 yo livestock if yo money is used up."
Ge 47:17	So they brought their herds 2 Joey, n Joey gave food 2 them in exchange 4 horses, their flocks, n their cattle n donkeys. And he provided them w food in exchange 4 all their livestock dat yr.
Ge 47:18	When dat yr ended, they came 2 him in da following yr n said 2 him, "We can’t hide from my lord dat our money n livestock belong 2 my lord. Nothin’ remains b4 my lord except our bodies n our land.
Ge 47:19	Y shud we die in front of u, both we n our land? Buy us n our land in exchange 4 food, then we n our land gonna be servants 2 Pharaoh. Then give us seed n we will live n not die, n da land won’t become desolate."
Ge 47:20	So Joey bought all da land of Egypt 4 Pharaoh, 4 each Egyptian sold his field, 4 da famine wuz severe on them. And da land became Pharaoh's.
Ge 47:21	As 4 da ppl, he transferred them 2 da cities, from 1 end of da territory of Egypt 2 da other.
Ge 47:22	Only da land of da priests he didn't buy, 4 there wuz an allotment 4 da priests from Pharaoh, n they lived on da allotment dat Pharaoh gave 2 them. So they didn't sell their land.
Ge 47:23	And Joey said 2 da ppl, "Look, i’ve bought u n yo land dis day 4 Pharaoh. Here is seed 4 u so u can sow da land.
Ge 47:24	And it’ll happen dat at da harvest, u must give a 5th 2 Pharaoh n 4-fifths will be urs, as seed 4 da field n 4 yo food n 4 those who r in yo households, n as food 4 yo lil’ ones."
Ge 47:25	And they said, "U hav saved our lives. If we've found favor in da eyes of my lord, we gonna be servants 2 Pharaoh."
Ge 47:26	So Joey made it a statute unto dis day abt da land of Egypt: 1 5th 2 Pharaoh. Only da land of da priests alone didn't belong 2 Pharaoh.
Ge 47:27	So Israel settled in da land of Egypt, in da land of Goshen. And they acquired possessions in it n were fruitful n multiplied greatly.
Ge 47:28	And Jake lived in da land of Egypt 17 yrs. And da days of Jake, da yrs of his lyf, were 1 hundred n forty-7 yrs.
Ge 47:29	When da time of Israel's death drew near, he called 2 his son, 2 Joey. And he said 2 him, "If i’ve found favor in yo eyes, please put yo hand under my thigh, dat u might vow 2 deal kindly n faithfully w me. Please don’t bury me in Egypt,
Ge 47:30	but let me lie w my ancestors. Carry me out of Egypt n bury me in their burial site." And he said, "i’ll do accordin’ 2 yo word."
Ge 47:31	Then he said, "Swear 2 me." And he swore 2 him. Then Israel bowed himself on da head of da bed. 


CHAPTER 48
Ge 48:1	And it happened dat after deez tingz, 'twas said 2 Joey, "Look, yo dad is ill." And he took his 2 sons w him, Ephraim n Manasseh.
Ge 48:2	And 'twas told 2 Jake, "Look, yo son Joey haz come 2 u." Then Israel strengthened himself n he sat up in da bed.
Ge 48:3	Then Jake said 2 Joey, "El-Shaddai appeared 2 me in Luz, in da land of Canaan, n blessed me,
Ge 48:4	n said 2 me, 'Look, i’ll make u fruitful n make u numerous, n will make u a company of nations. And i’ll give dis land 2 yo offspring after u as an everlasting possession.'
Ge 48:5	And now, yo 2 sons who were born 2 u in da land of Egypt b4 my comin’ 2 u in Egypt, r mine. Ephraim n Manasseh will be mine as Reuben n Simeon r.
Ge 48:6	And yo kids whom u dad after them will be urs. By da name of their bros they’ll be called, w respeck 2 their inheritance.
Ge 48:7	As 4 me, when i came 2 Paddan-Aram Rachel died 2 my sadness in da land of Canaan on da wae when there wuz still some distance 2 go 2 Ephrath. And i buried her there on da wey 2 Ephrath (dat’s, Bethlehem)."
Ge 48:8	When Israel saw da sons of Joey he said, "Who r deez?"
Ge 48:9	Then Joey said 2 his dad, "They r my sons whom God haz given me here." And he said, "Please bring them 2 me dat i may bless them."
Ge 48:10	Now da eyes of Israel were dim on account of old age; he wasn’t able 2 c. So he brought them near 2 him, n he kissed them n embraced them.
Ge 48:11	And Israel said 2 Joey, "i didn't expect 2 c yo face n look, God haz also shown me yo offspring."
Ge 48:12	Then Joey removed them from his knees n bowed down w his face 2 da ground.
Ge 48:13	And Joey took da 2 of them, Ephraim at his right 2 da left of Israel, n Manasseh at his left 2 da right of Israel. And he brought them near 2 him.
Ge 48:14	And Israel stretched out his right hand n put it on da head of Ephraim (now he wuz da younger), n his left hand on da head of Manasseh, crossing his hands, 4 Manasseh wuz da firstborn.
Ge 48:15	And he blessed Joey n said, 
 "Da God b4 whom my dads, Abe n Isaac, walked, Da God who shepherded me all my lyf unto dis day,
Ge 48:16	Da angel who redeemed me from all bad, may he bless da bois. And thru them let my name be perpetuated, n da name of my dads, Abe n Isaac. And let them multiply into many in da midst of da earth.

Ge 48:17	When Joey saw dat his dad put his right hand on da head of Ephraim, he wuz displeased. And he took hold of his dad's hand 2 remove it from da head of Ephraim over 2 da head of Manasseh.
Ge 48:18	And Joey said 2 his dad, "Not so, my dad; cuz dis 1 is da firstborn. Put yo right hand on his head."
Ge 48:19	But his dad refused n said, "i kno, my son; i kno. He also will become a ppl, n he also will be great, but his younger bro will be better than him, n his offspring will become a multitude of nations."
Ge 48:20	So he blessed them dat day, sayin’, 
 Thru u Israel will pronounce blessing, sayin’, 'May God make u like Ephraim n like Manasseh.'"
 So he put Ephraim b4 Manasseh.
Ge 48:21	And Israel said 2 Joey, "Look, im 'bout 2 die, but God gonna be w u n will bring u back 2 da land of yo ancestors.
Ge 48:22	And i’ve given 2 u 1 slope of land rather than yo bros, which i took from da hand of da Amorites by my sword n w my bow." 


CHAPTER 49
Ge 49:1	Then Jake called his sons n said, "Gather together so dat i can tell u wut will happen w u in days 2 come. 

Ge 49:2	Assemble n hear, O sons of Jake! Listen 2 Israel yo dad!
Ge 49:3	Reuben, u r my firstborn, my strength, n da firstfruit of my vigor, excelling in rank n excelling in power.
Ge 49:4	Unstable as water, u will not excel any longer, 4 u went up on da bed of yo dad, then defiled it. U went up on my couch!
Ge 49:5	Simeon n Levi r bros; weapons of violence r their swords. Let me not come into their council.
Ge 49:6	Let not my person be joined 2 their company. Cuz in their anger they killed men, n at their pleasure they hamstrung cattle.
Ge 49:7	Cursed be their anger, 4 it’s fierce, n their wrath, 4 it’s cruel. i’ll divide them in Jake, n i’ll scatter them in Israel.
Ge 49:8	Judah, as 4 u, yo bros will praise u. Yo hand will be on da neck of yo enemies. Da sons of yo dad will bow down 2 u.
Ge 49:9	Judah is a lion's cub. From da prey, my son, u hav gone up. He bowed down; he crouched like a lion n as a lioness. Who will rouse him?
Ge 49:10	Da scepter will not depart from Judah, nor da ruler's staff between his feet, until Shiloh comes. And 2 him will be da obedience of nations.
Ge 49:11	Binding his donkey 2 da vine n his donkey's colt 2 da choice vine, he washes his clothing in da wine n his garment in da blood of grapes.
Ge 49:12	Da eyes r darker than wine, n da teeth whiter than milk.
Ge 49:13	Zebulun will settle by da shore of da sea. He will become a haven 4 ships, n his border will be at Sidon.
Ge 49:14	Issachar is a strong donkey, crouching between da sheepfolds.
Ge 49:15	He saw a resting place dat wuz gud, n land dat wuz pleasant. So he bowed his shoulder 2 da burden n became a servant of forced labor.
Ge 49:16	Dan will judge his ppl as 1 of da tribes of Israel.
Ge 49:17	Dan will be a snek on da wae, a snek on da road dat bites da heels of a horse, so dat its rider falls backward.
Ge 49:18	i wait 4 yo salvation, O YHWH.
Ge 49:19	Bandits will attacc Gad, but he’ll attacc their heels.
Ge 49:20	Asher's food is delicious, n he’ll provide from da king's delicacies.
Ge 49:21	Naphtali is a doe running free dat puts forth beautiful words.
Ge 49:22	Joey is da bough of a fruitful vine, a fruitful bough by a spring. His branches climb over da wall.
Ge 49:23	Da archers fiercely attacked him. They shot arrows at him n were hostile 2 him.
Ge 49:24	But his bow remained in a steady position; his arms were made agile by da hands of da Mighty 1 of Jake. From there’s da Shepherd, da Rock of Israel.
Ge 49:25	Cuz of da God of yo dad he’ll help u n by Shaddai he’ll bless u w da blessings of heaven above, blessings of da deep dat crouches beneath, blessings of da breasts n da womb.
Ge 49:26	Da blessings of yo dad r superior 2 da blessings of my ancestors, 2 da bounty of da everlasting hills. May they be on da head of Joey, n on da forehead of da prince of his bros.
Ge 49:27	Ben is a devouring wolf, devouring da prey in da mornin’, n dividing da plunder in da evening.

Ge 49:28	All deez r da 12 tribes of Israel, n dis is wut their dad said 2 them when he blessed them, each accordin’ 2 their blessing.
Ge 49:29	Then he instructed them n said 2 them, "im 'bout 2 be gathered 2 my ppl. Bury me among my ancestors in da cave dat’s in da field of Ephron da Hittite,
Ge 49:30	in da cave dat’s in da field of Machpelah dat’s b4 Mamre in da land of Canaan, which Abe bought w da field from Ephron da Hittite as a burial site.
Ge 49:31	There they buried Abe n Sarah his wife. There they buried Isaac n Rebekah his wife. And there i buried Leah--
Ge 49:32	da purchase of da field n da cave which wuz in it from da Hittites."
Ge 49:33	When Jake finished instructing his sons he drew his feet up 2 da bed. Then he took his last breath n wuz gathered 2 his ppl. 


CHAPTER 50
Ge 50:1	Then Joey fell on da face of his dad n cried on him n kissed him.
Ge 50:2	And Joey instructed his servants da docs 2 embalm his dad. So da docs embalmed Israel.
Ge 50:3	Forty days were required 4 it, 4 so r da days required 4 embalming. And da Egyptians cried 4 him seventy days.
Ge 50:4	When da days of his weepin’ had passed, Joey spoke 2 da household of Pharaoh, sayin’, "If i’ve found favor in yo eyes, please talk in da hearing of Pharaoh, sayin’,
Ge 50:5	'My dad made me swear, sayin’, "Look, im 'bout 2 die. In da tomb dat i’ve hewed out 4 myself in da land of Canaan--there u must bury me." So then, please let me go up n let me bury my dad; then i’ll return.'"
Ge 50:6	Then Pharaoh said, "Go up n bury yo dad as he made u swear."
Ge 50:7	So Joey went up 2 bury his dad. And all da servants of Pharaoh, da elders of his household, n all da elders of da land of Egypt, went up w him,
Ge 50:8	w all da household of Joey, his bros, n da household of his dad. They left only their lil’ kids n their flocks n their herds in da land of Goshen.
Ge 50:9	And there also went up w him chariots n horsemen. Da company wuz great af.
Ge 50:10	When they came 2 da threshing floor of Atad, which wuz beyond da Jordan, they lamented there w a very great n sad wailing. And he made a mourning ceremony 4 his dad 7 days.
Ge 50:11	And when da Canaanites, da ppl of da land, saw da mourning ceremony at da threshing floor of Atad they said, "Dis is a severe mourning 4 da Egyptians." So its name wuz called Abel-Mizraim, which is beyond da Jordan.
Ge 50:12	So his sons did 2 him just like he had instructed them.
Ge 50:13	And his sons carried him 2 da land of Canaan n buried him in da cave of da field of Machpelah, which field Abe had bought as a burial site from Ephron da Hittite b4 Mamre.
Ge 50:14	And after burying his dad, Joey returned 2 Egypt, he n his bros n all who had gone up w him 2 bury his dad. 

Ge 50:15	And when da bros of Joey saw dat their dad wuz ded, they said, "It may be dat Joey will hold a grudge against us n pay us back dearly 4 all da bad dat we did 2 him."
Ge 50:16	So they sent word 2 Joey sayin’, "Yo dad commanded us b4 his death, sayin’,
Ge 50:17	"So u must tell Joey, 'O, please now forgive da transgression of yo bros n their sin, 4 they did bad 2 u.' So now, please forgive da transgression of da servants of da God of yo dad." And Joey cried when they spoke 2 him.
Ge 50:18	Then his bros went also n fell b4 him n said, "Look, we're yo servants."
