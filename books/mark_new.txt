CHAPTER 1
Mk 1:1	Da beginning of da gospel of JC.
Mk 1:2	Just as it’s written in da prophet Isaiah, 
 "Look, im sending my messenger b4 yo face, who will prepare yo wae,
Mk 1:3	da voice of 1 shouting in da wilderness, 'Prepare da wae of da Lord, make straight his paths!'"

Mk 1:4	Johnny wuz there baptizin’ in da wilderness, proclaiming a baptism of repentance 4 da forgiveness of sins.
Mk 1:5	And all da Judean region n all da ppl of Jerusalem went out 2 him n were bein’ baptized by him in da Jordan River, confessing their sins.
Mk 1:6	And Johnny wuz dressed in camel's hair n a belt made of leather around his waist, n he ate locusts n wild honey.
Mk 1:7	And he wuz preaching, sayin’, "1 who is more powerful than i is comin’ after me, of whom i ain’t worthy 2 bend down n untie da strap of his sandals.
Mk 1:8	i baptized u w water, but he’ll baptize u w da Holy Spirit." 

Mk 1:9	And it happened dat in those days Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee n wuz baptized in da Jordan by Johnny.
Mk 1:10	And immediately as he wuz comin’ up out of da water, he saw da heavens bein’ split apart n da Spirit goin’ down like a dove on him.
Mk 1:11	And a voice came from heaven, "U r my beloved Son; w u im well pleased." 

Mk 1:12	And immediately da Spirit drove him out into da wilderness.
Mk 1:13	And he wuz in da wilderness forty days bein’ tempted by Satan. And he wuz w da wild animals, n da angels were ministering 2 him. 

Mk 1:14	And after Johnny had been taken into custody, Jesus went into Galilee proclaiming da gospel of God
Mk 1:15	n sayin’, "Da time is fulfilled n da kingdom of God haz come near. Repent n believe in da gospel!" 

Mk 1:16	And as he wuz passing by along da Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon n Andrew, Simon's bro, casting a net into da sea (4 they were fishermen).
Mk 1:17	And Jesus said 2 them, "Follow me n i’ll make u become fishers of ppl."
Mk 1:18	And immediately they left their nets n followed him.
Mk 1:19	And goin’ on a lil’ farther, he saw James da son of Zebedee n his bro Johnny, n they were in da boat mending da nets.
Mk 1:20	And immediately he called them, n they left their dad Zebedee in da boat w da hired men n went away after him.
Mk 1:21	And they went into Capernaum n immediately on da Sabbath he began 2 teach in da synagogue. 

Mk 1:22	And they were amazed at his teaching, cuz he wuz teaching them like 1 who had authority, n not like da scribes.
Mk 1:23	And so then there wuz a man in their synagogue w an dirty spirit, n he cried out,
Mk 1:24	sayin’, "Leave us alone, Jesus da Nazarene! Hav u come 2 destroy us? i kno who u r--da Holy 1 of God!"
Mk 1:25	And Jesus roasted him, sayin’, "Be silent, n come out of him!"
Mk 1:26	And after convulsing him n crying out w a loud voice, da dirty spirit came out of him.
Mk 1:27	And they were all amazed, so dat they began 2 discuss w 1 anotha, sayin’, "Wut is dis? A new teaching w authority! He even commands da dirty spirits n they obey him."
Mk 1:28	And da report 'bout him then went out everywhere in da whole surrounding region of Galilee. 

Mk 1:29	And so then he departed from da synagogue n came into da house of Simon n Andrew w James n Johnny.
Mk 1:30	Now Simon's mom-in-law wuz lying down, suffering w a fever, n at once they told him 'bout her.
Mk 1:31	And he came n raised her up by taking hold of her hand, n da fever left her, n she began 2 serve them. 

Mk 1:32	Now when 'twas evening, when da sun had set, they began bringing 2 him all those who were sick n those who were demon-possessed.
Mk 1:33	And da whole town wuz gathered together at da door.
Mk 1:34	And he healed many who were sick w various diseases n expelled many demons. And he didn't permit da demons 2 talk, cuz they knew him. 

Mk 1:35	And getting up early in da mornin’ while 'twas dark af, he departed n went 2 a deserted place, n there he wuz praying.
Mk 1:36	And Simon n those who were w him searched diligently 4 him.
Mk 1:37	And they found him n said 2 him, "E’erybody is looking 4 u!"
Mk 1:38	And he said 2 them, "Let us go elsewhere, into da neighboring rural towns, so dat i can preach there also, cuz i’ve come out 4 dis very reason."
Mk 1:39	And he went into all Galilee preaching in their synagogues n expelling demons. 

Mk 1:40	And a leper came 2 him, entreating him n kneeling down, sayin’ 2 him, "If u r willing, u r able 2 make me clean."
Mk 1:41	And becoming angry, he stretched out his hand n touched him, n said 2 him, "im willing; be made clean."
Mk 1:42	And immediately da leprosy went away from him n he wuz made clean.
Mk 1:43	And warning him sternly, he sent him away at once.
Mk 1:44	And he said 2 him, "C 2 it dat u say nothin’ 2 anyone, but go, show yoself 2 da priest n bring 4 yo cleansing da tingz which Moe commanded, 4 a testimony 2 them.
Mk 1:45	But he went out n began 2 proclaim it freely n 2 spread abroad da account, so dat he wuz no longer able 2 enter publicly into a town. But he wuz stayin’ outside in deserted places, n they were comin’ 2 him from all directions. 


CHAPTER 2
Mk 2:1	And when he entered again into Capernaum after some days, it became known dat he wuz at home.
Mk 2:2	And many had gathered, so dat there wuz no longer room, not even at da door, n he wuz talkin’ da word 2 them.
Mk 2:3	And they came bringing 2 him a paralytic, carried by 4 of them.
Mk 2:4	And when they weren't able 2 bring him 2 him cuz of da crowd, they removed da roof where he wuz. And after digging thru, they lowered da stretcher on which da paralytic wuz lying.
Mk 2:5	And when Jesus saw their faith, he said 2 da paralytic, "Kid, yo sins r forgiven." 

Mk 2:6	Now some of da scribes were sitting there n reasoning in their hearts,
Mk 2:7	"Y does dis man talk like dis? He is blaspheming! Who is able 2 forgive sins except God alone?"
Mk 2:8	And immediately Jesus, perceiving in his spirit dat they were reasoning like dis within themselves, said 2 them, "Y r u considering deez tingz in yo hearts?
Mk 2:9	Which is easier 2 tell da paralytic, 'Yo sins r forgiven,' or 2 say 'Get up n pick up yo stretcher n walk'?
Mk 2:10	But so dat u may kno dat da Son of Man haz authority on earth 2 forgive sins,"--he said 2 da paralytic--
Mk 2:11	"i tell u, get up, pick up yo stretcher, n go 2 yo home."
Mk 2:12	And he got up n immediately picked up his stretcher n went out in front of them all, so dat they were all amazed n glorified God, sayin’, "We hav never seen anythin’ like dis!" 

Mk 2:13	And he went out again beside da sea, n all da crowd wuz comin’ 2 him, n he began 2 teach them.
Mk 2:14	And as he wuz passing by, he saw Levi da son of Alphaeus sitting at da tax booth, n he said 2 him, "Follow me!" And he stood up n followed him. 

Mk 2:15	And it happened dat he wuz dining in his house, n many tax collectors n sinners were dining w Jesus n his homies, 4 there were many n they were following him.
Mk 2:16	And da scribes of da Pharisees, when they saw dat he wuz eating w sinners n tax collectors, began 2 tell his homies, "Y does he eat w tax collectors n sinners?"
Mk 2:17	And when Jesus heard it, he said 2 them, "Those who r healthy don’t hav need of a doc, but those who r sick. i haven't come 2 call da gud, but sinners." 

Mk 2:18	And Johnny's homies n da Pharisees were fasting, n they came n said 2 him, "Y do da homeboys of Johnny n da homies of da Pharisees fast, but yo homeboys don’t fast?"
Mk 2:19	And Jesus said 2 them, "Da bridegroom's attendants aren’t able 2 fast while da bridegroom is w them, r they? As long a time as they hav da bridegroom w them, they aren’t able 2 fast.
Mk 2:20	But days will come when da bridegroom is taken away from them, n then they’ll fast in dat day.
Mk 2:21	No 1 sews a patch of unshrunken cloth on an old garment. Otherwise da patch pulls away from it--da new from da old--n da tear becomes worse.
Mk 2:22	And nobody puts new wine into old wineskins. Otherwise da wine will burst da wineskins n da wine is destroyed n da wineskins too. But new wine is put into new wineskins." 

Mk 2:23	And it happened dat he wuz goin’ thru da grain fields on da Sabbath, n his homies began 2 make their wey while plucking off da heads of grain.
Mk 2:24	And da Pharisees began 2 tell him, "Look, y r they doin’ wut isn’t ok on da Sabbath?"
Mk 2:25	And he said 2 them, "Hav u never read wut Dave did when he had need n he n those who were w him were hungry--
Mk 2:26	how he entered into da house of God in da time of Abiathar da high priest n ate da bread of da presentation, which it isn’t ok 2 eat (except da priests) n also gave it 2 those who were w him?"
Mk 2:27	And he said 2 them, "Da Sabbath wuz established 4 ppl, n not ppl 4 da Sabbath.
Mk 2:28	So then, da Son of Man is lord even of da Sabbath." 


CHAPTER 3
Mk 3:1	And he entered into da synagogue again, n a man who had a withered hand wuz there.
Mk 3:2	And they were watching him closely 2 c if he’d heal him on da Sabbath, so dat they could accuse him.
Mk 3:3	And he said 2 da man who had da withered hand, "Come into da middle."
Mk 3:4	And he said 2 them, "Is it permitted on da Sabbath 2 do gud or 2 do bad, 2 save lyf or 2 kill?" But they were silent.
Mk 3:5	And looking around at them w anger, grieved at da hardness of their hearts, he said 2 da man, "Stretch out yo hand." And he stretched it out, n his hand wuz restored.
Mk 3:6	And da Pharisees went out immediately w da Herodians n began 2 conspire against him w regard 2 how they could destroy him. 

Mk 3:7	And Jesus went away w his homies 2 da sea, n a great crowd from Galilee followed him. And from Judea
Mk 3:8	n from Jerusalem n from Idumea n da other side of da Jordan n around Tyre n Sidon a great crowd came 2 him cuz they heard all dat he wuz doin’.
Mk 3:9	And he told his homeboys dat a smol boat shud stand ready 4 him cuz of da crowd, so dat they’d not press on him.
Mk 3:10	Cuz he had healed many, so dat all those who were suffering from diseases pressed 'bout him so dat they could touch him.
Mk 3:11	And da dirty spirits, whenever they saw him, were falling down b4 him n crying out, sayin’, "U r da Son of God!"
Mk 3:12	And he warned them strictly dat they shouldn’t make him known. 

Mk 3:13	And he went up on da mountain n summoned those whom he wanted, n they came 2 him.
Mk 3:14	And he appointed 12, so dat they’d be w him n so dat he could send them out 2 preach
Mk 3:15	n 2 hav authority 2 expel demons.
Mk 3:16	And he appointed da 12. And 2 Simon he gave da name Pete,
Mk 3:17	n James da son of Zebedee n Johnny da bro of James (n he gave 2 them da name Boanerges, dat’s, "Sons of Thunder"),
Mk 3:18	n Andrew, n Phil, n Bartholomew, n Matty, n Tommy, n James da son of Alphaeus, n Thaddaeus, n Simon da Zealot,
Mk 3:19	n Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him. 

Mk 3:20	And he went home, n da crowd gathered again, so dat they weren't even able 2 eat a meal.
Mk 3:21	And when his fam heard dis, they went out 2 restrain him, 4 they were sayin’, "He haz lost his mind!" 

Mk 3:22	And da scribes who had come down from Jerusalem were sayin’, "He is possessed by Beelzebul!" n "By da ruler of da demons he expels da demons!"
Mk 3:23	And he called them 2 himself n wuz talkin’ 2 them in parables, "How can Satan expel Satan?
Mk 3:24	And if a kingdom is divided against itself, dat kingdom isn’t able 2 stand.
Mk 3:25	And if a house is divided against itself, dat house won’t be able 2 stand.
Mk 3:26	And if Satan haz risen up against himself n is divided, he’s not able 2 stand, but is at an end!
Mk 3:27	But nobody is able 2 enter into da house of a strong man n plunder his property unless he 1st ties up da strong man, n then he can thoroughly plunder his house. 

Mk 3:28	"TBH all da sins n da blasphemies gonna be forgiven da sons of men, however much they blaspheme.
Mk 3:29	But whoever blasphemes against da Holy Spirit doesn't hav forgiveness 4ever, but is guilty of an eternal sin"--
Mk 3:30	cuz they were sayin’, "He haz an dirty spirit." 

Mk 3:31	And his mom n his bros arrived, n standing outside, they sent word 2 him 2 summon him.
Mk 3:32	And a crowd wuz sitting around him, n they told him, "Look, yo mom n yo bros r outside looking 4 u."
Mk 3:33	And he answered them n said, "Who is my mom or my bros?"
Mk 3:34	And looking around at those who were sitting around him in a circle, he said, "Look, my mom n my bros!
Mk 3:35	Cuz whoever does da will of God, dis person is my bro n sister n mom." 


CHAPTER 4
Mk 4:1	And again he began 2 teach beside da sea, n a very large crowd wuz gathered 2 him, so dat he got into a boat n sat on da sea, n da whole crowd wuz at da sea on da land.
Mk 4:2	And he began 2 teach them many tingz in parables, n wuz sayin’ 2 them in his teaching,
Mk 4:3	"Listen! Look, da sower went out 2 sow.
Mk 4:4	And it happened dat while he wuz sowing, some seed fell on da side of da path, n da birbs came n devoured it.
Mk 4:5	And other seed fell on da rocky ground where it didn't hav much soil, n it sprang up at once, cuz it didn't hav any depth of soil.
Mk 4:6	And when da sun rose 'twas scorched, n cuz it didn't hav enough root, it withered.
Mk 4:7	And other seed fell among da thorn plants, n da thorn plants came up n choked it, n it didn't produce grain.
Mk 4:8	And other seed fell on da gud soil, n produced grain, comin’ up n increasing, n it bore a crop--1 thirty n 1 sixty n 1 a hundred times as much.
Mk 4:9	And he said, "Whoever haz ears 2 hear, let him hear!" 

Mk 4:10	And when he wuz alone, those around him together w da 12 began asking him 'bout da parables.
Mk 4:11	And he said 2 them, "2 u haz been granted da secret of da kingdom of God, but 2 those who r outside everythin’ is in parables,
Mk 4:12	so dat 
 'they may look closely n not perceive, n they may listen carefully n not understand, lest they turn n it be forgiven them.'"

Mk 4:13	And he said 2 them, "Do u not understand dis parable? And how’ll u understand all da parables?
Mk 4:14	Da sower sows da word.
Mk 4:15	And deez r da ones beside da path where da word is sown, n whenever they hear it, immediately Satan comes n takes away da word dat wuz sown in them.
Mk 4:16	And deez r like da ones sown on da rocky ground, who whenever they hear da word immediately get it w happiness.
Mk 4:17	And they hav no root in themselves, but r temporary. Then when affliction or persecution comes cuz of da word, immediately they fall away.
Mk 4:18	And others r da ones sown among da thorn plants--deez r da ones who hear da word,
Mk 4:19	n da cares of da world n da deceitfulness of wealth n da desires 4 other tingz come in n choke da word n it becomes unproductive.
Mk 4:20	And those r da ones sown on da gud soil, who hear da word n get it n bear fruit--1 thirty n 1 sixty n 1 a hundred times as much." 

Mk 4:21	And he said 2 them, "Ofc a lamp isn’t brought so dat it may be put under a bushel basket or under a bed, is it? Is it not so dat it may be put on a lampstand?
Mk 4:22	Cuz nothin’ is secret except so dat it may be revealed, nor haz become hidden except so dat it’ll come 2 light.
Mk 4:23	If anyone haz ears 2 hear, let him hear!"
Mk 4:24	And he said 2 them, "Take care wut u hear! Wit da measure by which u measure out, it gonna be measured out 2 u, n gonna be added 2 u.
Mk 4:25	Cuz whoever haz, more gonna be given 2 him, n whoever doesn't hav, even wut he’s gonna be taken away from him." 

Mk 4:26	And he said, "Da kingdom of God is like dis: like a man scatters seed on da ground.
Mk 4:27	And he sleeps n gets up, night n day, n da seed sprouts n grows--he doesn't kno how.
Mk 4:28	By itself da soil produces a crop: 1st da grass, then da head of grain, then da full grain in da head.
Mk 4:29	But when da crop permits, he sends in da sickle right away, cuz da harvest haz come." 

Mk 4:30	And he said, "Wit wut can we compare da kingdom of God, or by wut parable can we present it?
Mk 4:31	It’s like a mustard seed dat when sown on da ground, even tho it’s da smolest of all da seeds dat r on da ground,
Mk 4:32	but when it’s sown it grows up n becomes da largest of all da garden herbs, n sends out large branches so dat da birbs of da sky r able 2 nest in its shade."
Mk 4:33	And w many parables such as deez he wuz talkin’ da word 2 them, as they were able 2 hear it.
Mk 4:34	And he didn't talk 2 them without a parable, but in private he explained everythin’ 2 his own homies. 

Mk 4:35	And on dat day, when 'twas evening, he said 2 them, "Let us cross over 2 da other side."
Mk 4:36	And leaving da crowd, they took him along, as he wuz, in da boat. And other boats were w him.
Mk 4:37	And a great storm of wind developed, n da waves were breaking into da boat, so dat da boat wuz already bein’ filled w water.
Mk 4:38	And he wuz in da stern sleeping on da cushion, n they woke him up n said 2 him, "Teacher, is it not a concern 2 u dat we're dyin’?"
Mk 4:39	And he woke up n roasted da wind, n said 2 da sea, "Be quiet! Be silent!" And da wind stopped n there wuz a great calm.
Mk 4:40	And he said 2 them, "Y r u scared? Do u not yet hav faith?"
Mk 4:41	And they were terribly frightened n began 2 tell 1 anotha, "Who then is dis, dat even da wind n da sea obey him?" 


CHAPTER 5
Mk 5:1	And they came 2 da other side of da sea, 2 da region of da Gerasenes.
Mk 5:2	And as he wuz getting out of da boat, immediately from da tombs a man w an dirty spirit went 2 meet him,
Mk 5:3	who lived among da tombs. And nobody wuz able 2 bind him any longer, not even w a chain,
Mk 5:4	cuz he had often been bound w shackles n chains, n da chains had been torn apart by him, n da shackles had been shattered. And nobody wuz strong enough 2 subdue him.
Mk 5:5	And during every night n day among da tombs n on da mountains he wuz crying out n cutting himself w stones.
Mk 5:6	And when he saw Jesus from a distance, he ran n knelt down b4 him.
Mk 5:7	And crying out w a loud voice he said, "Wut hav i 2 do w u, Jesus, Son of da Most High God? i beg u by God, don’t torment me!"
Mk 5:8	(Cuz he wuz sayin’ 2 him, "Come out of da man, dirty spirit!")
Mk 5:9	And he wuz asking him "Wut is yo name?" And he said 2 him, "My name is Legion, cuz we're many."
Mk 5:10	And he wuz begging him many times dat he’d not send them out of da region.
Mk 5:11	Now a large herd of pigs wuz there at da hill feeding,
Mk 5:12	n they begged him, sayin’, "Send us 2 da pigs so dat we may enter into them."
Mk 5:13	And he permitted them. And da dirty spirits came out n entered into da pigs, n da herd--'bout 2 K--rushed headlong down da steep slope into da sea n were drowned in da sea.
Mk 5:14	And their herdsmen fled n reported it in da town n in da countryside, n they came 2 c wut 'twas dat had happened.
Mk 5:15	And they came 2 Jesus n saw da demon-possessed man sitting there clothed n in his right mind--da 1 who had had da legion--n they were afraid.
Mk 5:16	And those who had seen it described 2 them wut had happened 2 da demon-possessed man, n 'bout da pigs.
Mk 5:17	And they began 2 urge him 2 depart from their region.
Mk 5:18	And as he wuz getting into da boat, da man who had been demon-possessed began 2 beg him dat he could go w him.
Mk 5:19	And he didn't permit him, but said 2 him, "Go 2 yo home 2 yo ppl n tell them all dat da Lord haz done 4 u, n dat he’s had mercy on u."
Mk 5:20	And he went away n began 2 proclaim in da Decapolis all dat Jesus had done 4 him, n they were all shook. 

Mk 5:21	And after Jesus had crossed over again in da boat 2 da other side, a large crowd gathered 2 him, n he wuz beside da sea.
Mk 5:22	And 1 of da rulers of da synagogue came--Jairus by name--n when he saw him, he fell down at his feet.
Mk 5:23	And he wuz begging him many times, sayin’, "My lil’ daughter is at da point of death! Come, lay yo hands on her, so dat she’ll get well n will live."
Mk 5:24	And he went w him, n a large crowd wuz following him n pressing around him. 

Mk 5:25	And there wuz a woman who wuz suffering from hemorrhages 12 yrs.
Mk 5:26	And she had endured many tingz under many docs, n had spent all dat she had n had received no help at all, but instead became worse.
Mk 5:27	When she heard 'bout Jesus, she came up in da crowd behind him n touched his cloak,
Mk 5:28	4 she wuz sayin’, "If i touch just his clothing, i gonna be healed!"
Mk 5:29	And immediately her hemorrhage stopped n she realized in her body dat she wuz healed of her suffering.
Mk 5:30	And immediately Jesus, perceiving in himself dat power had gone out from himself, turned around in da crowd n said, "Who touched my clothing?"
Mk 5:31	And his homeboys said 2 him, "U c da crowd pressing on u, n u say 'Who touched me?'"
Mk 5:32	And he wuz looking around 2 c da 1 who had done dis.
Mk 5:33	So da woman, frightened n trembling, knowing wut had happened 2 her, came n fell down b4 him n told him da whole truth.
Mk 5:34	But he said 2 her, "Daughter, yo faith haz healed u. Go in pce n be well from yo suffering." 

Mk 5:35	While he wuz still talkin’, they came from da synagogue ruler's house sayin’, "Yo daughter haz died. Y trouble da Teacher further?"
Mk 5:36	But Jesus, ignoring wut wuz said, told da ruler of da synagogue, "Don’t be afraid--only believe!"
Mk 5:37	And he didn't allow anyone 2 follow along w him except Pete n James n Johnny, da bro of James.
Mk 5:38	And they came 2 da house of da ruler of da synagogue n saw a commotion, n ppl weepin’ n wailing loudly.
Mk 5:39	And when he entered, he said 2 them, "Y r u agitated n weepin’? Da kid isn’t ded, but is sleeping."
Mk 5:40	And they began laughing at him. But he sent them all out n took along da dad n mom of da kid, n those who were w him, n went in 2 where da kid wuz.
Mk 5:41	And taking hold of da kid's hand, he said 2 her, "Talitha koum!" (which is translated, "Lil’ girl, i tell u, get up!"),
Mk 5:42	n immediately da girl stood up n began walking around (4 she wuz 12 yrs old). And immediately they were utterly n totally shook.
Mk 5:43	And he commanded them strictly dat nobody shud learn of dis, n said 2 give her somethin’ 2 eat. 


CHAPTER 6
Mk 6:1	And he went out from there n came 2 his hometown, n his homies followed him.
Mk 6:2	And when da Sabbath came, he began 2 teach in da synagogue, n many who heard him were amazed, sayin’, "Where did dis man get deez tingz? And wut is dis wisdom dat’s been granted 2 dis man, n da miracles such as deez performed thru his hands?
Mk 6:3	Is not dis da carpenter, da son of Mary n bro of James n Joses n Judas n Simon? And aren’t his sisters here w us?" And they were offended by him.
Mk 6:4	And Jesus said 2 them, "A prophet isn’t without honor except in his hometown, n among his relatives, n in his own household."
Mk 6:5	And he wasn’t able 2 do any miracle in dat place except 2 lay his hands on a few sick ppl n heal them.
Mk 6:6	And he wuz shook cuz of their unbelief. 

Mk 6:7	And he summoned da 12 n began 2 send them out 2 by 2, n gave them authority over da dirty spirits.
Mk 6:8	And he commanded them dat they take along nothin’ 4 da journey except only a staff--no bread, no traveler's bag, no money in their belts--
Mk 6:9	but 2 put on sandals n not 2 wear 2 tunics.
Mk 6:10	And he said 2 them, "Whenever u enter into a house, stay there until u depart from there.
Mk 6:11	And whatever place doesn't welcome u or listen 2 u, as u go out from there, shake off da dust dat’s on yo feet 4 a testimony against them."
Mk 6:12	And they went out n proclaimed dat ppl shud repent.
Mk 6:13	And they were expelling many demons n anointing many sick ppl w olive oil n healing them. 

Mk 6:14	And King Herod heard it, cuz his name had become known. And they were sayin’, "Johnny, da 1 who baptizes, haz been raised from da ded, n cuz of dis deez miraculous powers r at work in him."
Mk 6:15	But others were sayin’, "He is Elijah," n others were sayin’, "He is a prophet like 1 of da prophets."
Mk 6:16	But when Herod heard it, he said, "Johnny whom i beheaded--dis 1 haz been raised!"
Mk 6:17	Cuz Herod himself had sent n arrested Johnny n bound him in prison cuz of Herodias, da wife of Phil his bro, cuz he had married her.
Mk 6:18	Cuz Johnny had been sayin’ 2 Herod, "It isn’t ok 4 u 2 hav yo bro's wife."
Mk 6:19	So Herodias held a grudge against him n wuz wanting 2 kill him, n wasn’t able 2 do so.
Mk 6:20	Cuz Herod wuz afraid of Johnny, cuz he knew him 2 be a gud n holy man n protected him. And when he listened 2 him, he wuz greatly perplexed, n yet he listened 2 him gladly.
Mk 6:21	And a suitable day came when Herod, on his birthday, gave a banquet 4 his courtiers n military tribunes n da most prominent men of Galilee.
Mk 6:22	And when da daughter of Herodias herself came in n danced n pleased Herod n his dinner guests, da king said 2 da girl, "Ask me 4 whatever u want, n i’ll give it 2 u."
Mk 6:23	And he swore 2 her, "Anythin’ whatever u ask me cuz i’ll give u, up 2 half my kingdom!"
Mk 6:24	And she went out n said 2 her mom, "Wut shud i ask 4?" And she said, "Da head of Johnny da baptizer."
Mk 6:25	And she came in immediately w haste 2 da king n asked, sayin’, "i want u 2 gimme da head of Johnny da Baptist on a platter immediately."
Mk 6:26	And even tho he wuz deeply grieved, da king, cuz of his oaths n dinner guests, didn't wanna refuse her.
Mk 6:27	And immediately da king sent an executioner n ordered him 2 bring his head. And he went n beheaded him in da jail.
Mk 6:28	And he brought his head on a platter n gave it 2 da girl, n da girl gave it 2 her mom.
Mk 6:29	And when his homeboys heard dis, they came n took away his corpse n placed it in a tomb. 

Mk 6:30	And da apostles regathered 2 Jesus n reported 2 him everythin’ dat they had done n dat they had taught.
Mk 6:31	And he said 2 them, "U yoselves come privately 2 an isolated place n rest 4 a short time." Cuz those who were comin’ n goin’ were many, n they didn't even hav time 2 eat.
Mk 6:32	And they went away in da boat 2 an isolated place by themselves.
Mk 6:33	And many ppl saw them leaving n recognized them, n ran there together by land from all da towns, n arrived ahead of them.
Mk 6:34	And getting out of da boat he saw da large crowd n had compassion on them, cuz they were like sheep without a shepherd, n he began 2 teach them many tingz.
Mk 6:35	And da hr had already become late when his homies came up 2 him, sayin’, "Da place is desolate n da hr is already late.
Mk 6:36	Send them away so dat they can go into da surrounding farms n villages n purchase somethin’ 2 eat 4 themselves."
Mk 6:37	But he answered n said 2 them, "U give them somethin’ 2 eat." And they said 2 him, "Shud we go n purchase bread 4 2 hundred denarii n give it 2 them 2 eat?"
Mk 6:38	And he said 2 them, "How many loaves do u hav? Go look!" And when they found out, they said, "5, n 2 fish."
Mk 6:39	And he ordered them all 2 recline in groups on da green grass.
Mk 6:40	And they reclined in groups, by hundreds n by fifties.
Mk 6:41	And taking da 5 loaves n da 2 fish n looking up 2 heaven, he gave thanks n broke da loaves n gave them 2 his homies so dat they could set them b4 them. And he distributed da 2 fish 2 them all.
Mk 6:42	And they all ate n were satisfied.
Mk 6:43	And they picked up da broken pieces, 12 baskets full, n of da fish.
Mk 6:44	And those who ate da loaves were 5 K men. 

Mk 6:45	And immediately he made his homeboys get into da boat n go on ahead 2 da other side, 2 Bethsaida, while he himself dismissed da crowd.
Mk 6:46	And after he had said farewell 2 them, he went away 2 da mountain 2 pray.
Mk 6:47	And when evening came, da boat wuz in da middle of da sea n he wuz alone on da land.
Mk 6:48	And he saw them bein’ beaten in their rowing cuz da wind wuz against them. Around da 4th watch of da night he came 2 them, walking on da sea, n he wuz wanting 2 pass by them.
Mk 6:49	But when they saw him walking on da sea, they thought dat 'twas a ghost, n they cried out.
Mk 6:50	Cuz they all saw him n were terrified. But immediately he spoke w them n said 2 them, "Hav courage, im he! Don’t be afraid!"
Mk 6:51	And he went up w them into da boat, n da wind stopped. And they were extraordinarily astounded within themselves,
Mk 6:52	cuz they didn't understand abt da loaves, but their hearts were hardened. 

Mk 6:53	And after they had crossed over, they came 2 land at Gennesaret n anchored there.
Mk 6:54	And as they were getting out of da boat, ppl recognized him immediately.
Mk 6:55	They ran 'bout thru dat whole region n began 2 carry around those who were sick on stretchers, wherever they heard dat he wuz.
Mk 6:56	And wherever he’d go, into villages or into towns or 2 farms, they’d put those who were sick in da marketplaces n would beg him dat if they could touch even da edge of his cloak. And all those who touched it were healed. 


CHAPTER 7
Mk 7:1	And da Pharisees n some of da scribes who had come from Jerusalem gathered 2 him.
Mk 7:2	And they saw dat some of his homies were eating their bread w dirty--dat’s, unwashed--hands.
Mk 7:3	(Cuz da Pharisees n all da Jews don’t eat unless they wash their hands ritually, so holding fast 2 da traditions of da elders.
Mk 7:4	And when they come from da marketplace, they don’t eat unless they wash. And there r many other traditions which they hav received n hold fast 2--4 example, da washing of cups n pitchers n bronze kettles n dining couches.)
Mk 7:5	And da Pharisees n da scribes asked him, "Y do yo homies not live accordin’ 2 da tradition of da elders, but eat their bread w dirty hands?"
Mk 7:6	So he said 2 them, "Isaiah prophesied correctly 'bout u hypocrites, as it’s written, 
 'Dis ppl honors me w their lips, but their heart is far, far away from me.
Mk 7:7	And they worship me in vain, teaching as doctrines da rules of men.'

Mk 7:8	Abandoning da rule of God, u hold fast 2 da tradition of men." 

Mk 7:9	And he said 2 them, "U splendidly ignore da rule of God so dat u can keep yo tradition.
Mk 7:10	Cuz Moe said, 'Honor yo dad n yo mom,' n, 'Da 1 who speaks bad of dad or mom must totally die.'
Mk 7:11	But u say, 'If a man says 2 his dad or 2 his mom, "Whatever benefit u would’ve received from me is corban" (dat’s, a gift 2 God),
Mk 7:12	u no longer permit him 2 do anythin’ 4 his dad or his mom,
Mk 7:13	so making void da word of God by yo tradition dat u hav handed down, n u do many similar tingz such as dis." 

Mk 7:14	And summoning da crowd again, he said 2 them, "Listen 2 me, all of u, n understand:
Mk 7:15	There is nothin’ outside of a person dat’s able 2 defile him by goin’ into him. But da tingz dat go out of a person r da tingz dat defile a person."
Mk 7:17	And when he entered into da house away from da crowd, his homies asked him 'bout da parable.
Mk 7:18	And he said 2 them, "So r u also without understanding? Do u not understand dat everythin’ dat’s outside dat goes into a person isn’t able 2 defile him?
Mk 7:19	Cuz it doesn't enter into his heart but into his stomach, n goes out into da toilet"--so declaring all foods clean.
Mk 7:20	And he said, "Wut comes out of a person, dat defiles a person.
Mk 7:21	Cuz from within, from da heart of ppl, come bad plans, sexual immoralities, thefts, murders,
Mk 7:22	adulteries, acts of greed, malicious deeds, deceit, licentiousness, envy, abusive speech, pride, stupidity.
Mk 7:23	All deez bad tingz come from within n defile a person." 

Mk 7:24	And from there he set out n went 2 da region of Tyre. And when he entered into a house, he wanted nobody 2 kno, n yet he wasn’t able 2 escape notice.
Mk 7:25	But immediately a woman whose yung daughter wuz possessed by an dirty spirit, when she heard 'bout him, came n fell down at his feet,
Mk 7:26	Now da woman wuz a Greek--a Syrophoenician by nationality--n she wuz asking him dat he’d expel da demon from her daughter.
Mk 7:27	And he said 2 her, "Let da kids be satisfied 1st, 4 it isn’t right 2 take da kids's bread n yeet it 2 da doggos!"
Mk 7:28	But she answered n said 2 him, "Lord, even da doggos under da table eat da kids's crumbs."
Mk 7:29	And he said 2 her, "Cuz of dis statement, go! Da demon haz gone out of yo daughter."
Mk 7:30	And when she went 2 her home, she found da kid lying on da bed n da demon gone. 

Mk 7:31	And again he went away from da region of Tyre n came thru Sidon 2 da Sea of Galilee, within da region of da Decapolis.
Mk 7:32	And they brought 2 him a man who wuz deaf n had difficulty talkin’, n they were begging him dat he’d place his hand on him.
Mk 7:33	And he took him away from da crowd by himself n put his fingers into his ears, n after spitting, he touched his tongue.
Mk 7:34	And looking up 2 heaven, he sighed n said 2 him, "Ephphatha!" (dat’s, "Be opened!").
Mk 7:35	And his ears were opened n his difficulty in talkin’ wuz removed n he began 2 talk normally.
Mk 7:36	And he ordered them dat they shud say nothin’, but as much as he ordered them not 2, they proclaimed it even more instead.
Mk 7:37	And they were amazed beyond all measure, sayin’, "He haz done all tingz well! He even makes da deaf hear n da mute talk!" 


CHAPTER 8
Mk 8:1	In those days there wuz again a large crowd, n they didn't hav anythin’ they could eat. Summoning da homeboys, he said 2 them,
Mk 8:2	"i’ve compassion on da crowd, cuz they hav remained w me 3 days already n don’t hav anythin’ 2 eat.
Mk 8:3	And if i send them away hungry 2 their homes they’ll give out on da wey, n some of them hav come from far away."
Mk 8:4	And his homeboys answered him, "Where is anyone able 2 feed deez ppl w bread here in da desert?"
Mk 8:5	And he asked them, "How many loaves do u hav?" So they said, "7."
Mk 8:6	And he commanded da crowd 2 recline 4 a meal on da ground, n taking da 7 loaves, after he had given thanks he broke them n began giving them 2 his homeboys so dat they could set them b4 them. And they set them b4 da crowd.
Mk 8:7	And they had a few smol fish, n after giving thanks 4 them, he said 2 set deez b4 them also.
Mk 8:8	And they ate n were satisfied, n they picked up da broken pieces dat were left, 7 baskets full.
Mk 8:9	Now there were 'bout 4 K. And he sent them away.
Mk 8:10	And immediately he got into da boat w his homeboys n went 2 da district of Dalmanutha. 

Mk 8:11	And da Pharisees came n began 2 argue w him, demanding from him a sign from heaven in order 2 test him.
Mk 8:12	And sighing deeply in his spirit, he said, "Y does dis generation demand a sign? TBH, no sign gonna be given 2 dis generation!"
Mk 8:13	And he left them, got into da boat again, n went 2 da other side. 

Mk 8:14	And they had forgotten 2 take bread, n except 4 1 loaf, they didn't hav any w them in da boat.
Mk 8:15	And he ordered them, sayin’, "Watch out! Beware of da leaven of da Pharisees n da leaven of Herod!"
Mk 8:16	And they began 2 discuss w 1 anotha dat they had no bread.
Mk 8:17	And knowing dis, he said 2 them, "Y r u discussing dat u hav no bread? Do u not yet perceive or understand? Hav yo hearts been hardened?
Mk 8:18	Even tho u hav eyes, do u not c? And even tho u hav ears, do u not hear? And do u not remember?
Mk 8:19	When i broke da 5 loaves 4 da 5 K how many baskets full of broken pieces did u pick up?" They said 2 him, "12."
Mk 8:20	"When i also broke da 7 loaves 4 da 4 K, how many baskets full of broken pieces did u pick up?" And they said 2 him, "7."
Mk 8:21	And he said 2 them, "Do u not yet understand?" 

Mk 8:22	And they came 2 Bethsaida. And they brought 2 him a blind man n begged him dat he’d touch him.
Mk 8:23	And he took hold of da blind man's hand n led him outside da village, n after spitting in his eyes, he placed his hands on him n asked him, "Do u c anythin’?"
Mk 8:24	And looking up he said, "i c ppl, cuz i c them like trees walking around."
Mk 8:25	Then he placed his hands on his eyes again, n he opened his eyes n wuz cured, n could c everythin’ clearly.
Mk 8:26	And he sent him 2 his home, sayin’, "Don’t even go into da village." 

Mk 8:27	And Jesus n his homies went out 2 da villages of Caesarea Philippi, n on da wey he asked his homies, sayin’ 2 them, "Who do ppl say dat im?"
Mk 8:28	And they told him, sayin’, "Johnny da Baptist, n others Elijah, n others dat u r 1 of da prophets."
Mk 8:29	And he asked them, "But who do u say dat im?" Pete answered n said 2 him, "U r da Christ!"
Mk 8:30	And he warned them dat they shud tell nobody 'bout him. 

Mk 8:31	And he began 2 teach them dat 'twas necessary 4 da Son of Man 2 suffer many tingz n 2 be rejected by da elders n da chief priests n da scribes, n 2 be killed, n after 3 days 2 rise.
Mk 8:32	And he wuz talkin’ openly 'bout da subject, n Pete took him aside n began 2 roast him.
Mk 8:33	But turning around n seeing his homeboys, he roasted Pete n said, "Get behind me, Satan, cuz u aren’t setting yo mind on da tingz of God, but da tingz of ppl!" 

Mk 8:34	And summoning da crowd together w his homeboys, he said 2 them, "If anyone wants 2 come after me, let him deny himself n take up his cross n follow me.
Mk 8:35	Cuz whoever wants 2 save his lyf will lose it, but whoever loses his lyf on account of me n of da gospel will save it.
Mk 8:36	Cuz wut does it benefit a person 2 gain da whole world n forfeit his lyf?
Mk 8:37	Cuz wut can a person give in exchange 4 his lyf?
Mk 8:38	Cuz whoever is ashamed of me n my words in dis adulterous n sinful generation, da Son of Man will also be ashamed of him when he comes in da glory of his Dad w da holy angels." 


CHAPTER 9
Mk 9	
Mk 9:1	And he said 2 them, "TBH, dat there r some of those standing here who will never experience death until they c da kingdom of God having come w power." 

Mk 9:2	And after 6 days, Jesus took along Pete n James n Johnny, n led them 2 a high mountain by themselves alone. And he wuz transfigured b4 them,
Mk 9:3	n his clothing became radiant--extremely white, like no cloth refiner on earth can make so white.
Mk 9:4	And Elijah appeared 2 them together w Moe, n they were talking w Jesus.
Mk 9:5	And Pete answered n said 2 Jesus, "Rabbi, it’s gud dat we're here! And let’s make 3 shelters, 1 4 u n 1 4 Moe n 1 4 Elijah."
Mk 9:6	(Cuz he didn't kno wut he shud answer, cuz they were terrified.)
Mk 9:7	And a cloud came, overshadowing them, n a voice came from da cloud, "Dis is my beloved Son. Listen 2 him!"
Mk 9:8	And suddenly, looking around, they no longer saw anyone w them but Jesus alone. 

Mk 9:9	And as they were comin’ down from da mountain, he ordered them dat they shud tell nobody da tingz dat they had seen, except when da Son of Man had risen from da ded.
Mk 9:10	And they kept da matter 2 themselves, discussing wut dis rising from da ded meant.
Mk 9:11	And they asked him, sayin’, "Y do da scribes say dat Elijah must come 1st?"
Mk 9:12	And he said 2 them, "Elijah indeed does come 1st n restores all tingz. And how’s it written abt da Son of Man dat he shud suffer many tingz n be treated w contempt?
Mk 9:13	But i tell u dat indeed Elijah haz come, n they did 2 him whatever they wanted, just like it’s written 'bout him." 

Mk 9:14	And when they came 2 da homeboys, they saw a large crowd around them n scribes arguing w them.
Mk 9:15	And immediately da whole crowd, when they saw him, were amazed, n ran up 2 him n greeted him.
Mk 9:16	And he asked them, "Wut r u arguing 'bout w them?"
Mk 9:17	And 1 individual from da crowd answered him, "Teacher, i brought 2 u my son who haz a spirit dat makes him mute.
Mk 9:18	And whenever it seizes him, it throws him down n he foams at da mouth n grinds his teeth n becomes paralyzed. And i told yo homies dat they shud expel it, n they weren't able 2 do so.
Mk 9:19	And he answered them n said, "O unbelieving generation! How long will i be w u? How long must i put up w u? Bring him 2 me!"
Mk 9:20	And they brought him 2 him. And when he saw him, da spirit immediately convulsed him, n falling on da ground, he began 2 roll around, foaming at da mouth.
Mk 9:21	And he asked his dad how long 'twas since dis had been happening 2 him. And he said, "From childhood.
Mk 9:22	And often it’s yeeted him both into fire n into water, so dat it could destroy him. But if u r able 2 do anythin’, hav compassion on us n help us!"
Mk 9:23	But Jesus said 2 him, "If u r able! All tingz r possible 4 da 1 who believes!"
Mk 9:24	Immediately da dad of da kid cried out n said, "i believe! Help my unbelief!"
Mk 9:25	Now when Jesus saw dat a crowd wuz running together, he roasted da dirty spirit, sayin’ 2 it, "Mute n deaf spirit, i command u, come out of him, n enter into him no more!"
Mk 9:26	And it came out, screaming n convulsing him greatly, n he became as if he were ded, so dat most of them said, "He haz died!"
Mk 9:27	But Jesus took hold of his hand n raised him up, n he stood up.
Mk 9:28	And after he had entered into da house, his homeboys asked him privately, "Y were we not able 2 expel it?"
Mk 9:29	And he said 2 them, "Dis kind can come out by nothin’ except by prayer." 

Mk 9:30	And from there they went out n passed thru Galilee. And he didn't want anyone 2 kno,
Mk 9:31	4 he wuz teaching his homeboys n wuz telling them, "Da Son of Man is bein’ betrayed into da hands of men, n they’ll kill him. And when he’s killed, after 3 days he’ll rise."
Mk 9:32	But they didn't understand da statement, n they were afraid 2 ask him. 

Mk 9:33	And they came 2 Capernaum. And after he wuz in da house, he asked them, "Wut were u discussing on da wae?"
Mk 9:34	But they were silent, cuz they had argued w 1 anotha on da wae 'bout who wuz best.
Mk 9:35	And he sat down n called da 12 n said 2 them, "If anyone wants 2 be 1st, he gonna be last of all n servant of all."
Mk 9:36	And he took a yung kid n had him stand among them. And taking him in his arms, he said 2 them,
Mk 9:37	"Whoever welcomes 1 of da yung kids such as deez in my name welcomes me, n whoever welcomes me doesn't welcome me, but da 1 who sent me." 

Mk 9:38	Johnny said 2 him, "Teacher, we saw someone expelling demons in yo name, n we tried 2 prevent him cuz he wasn’t following us."
Mk 9:39	But Jesus said, "Don’t prevent him, cuz there’s nobody who does a miracle in my name n gonna be able soon afterward 2 talk bad of me.
Mk 9:40	Cuz whoever isn’t against us is 4 us.
Mk 9:41	Cuz whoever gives u a cup of water 2 drink in my name cuz u r Christ's, tbh he’ll never lose his reward. 

Mk 9:42	"And whoever causes 1 of deez lil’ ones who believe in me 2 sin, it’s better 4 him if instead a large millstone is placed around his neck n he’s yeeted into da sea.
Mk 9:43	And if yo hand causes u 2 sin, cut it off! It’s better 4 u 2 enter into lyf crippled than, having 2 hands, 2 go into hell--into da unquenchable fire!
Mk 9:45	And if yo foot causes u 2 sin, cut it off! It’s better 4 u 2 enter into lyf lame than, having 2 feet, 2 be yeeted into hell!
Mk 9:47	And if yo eye causes u 2 sin, tear it out! It’s better 4 u 2 enter into da kingdom of God w 1 eye than, having 2 eyes, 2 be yeeted into hell,
Mk 9:48	'where their worm doesn't die n da fire isn’t extinguished.'
Mk 9:49	Cuz e’erybody gonna be salted w fire.
Mk 9:50	Salt is gud, but if da salt becomes deprived of its salt content, by wut can u make it salty? Hav salt among yoselves, n be at pce w 1 anotha." 


CHAPTER 10
Mk 10:1	And from there he set out n came 2 da region of Judea n da other side of da Jordan, n again crowds came together 2 him. And again, as he wuz accustomed 2 do, he began 2 teach them.
Mk 10:2	And they asked him if 'twas permitted 4 a man 2 divorce his wife, in order 2 test him.
Mk 10:3	And he answered n said 2 them, "Wut did Moe command u?"
Mk 10:4	So they said, "Moe permitted a man 2 write a certificate of divorce n 2 send her away."
Mk 10:5	But Jesus said 2 them, "He wrote dis rule 4 u cuz of yo hardness of heart.
Mk 10:6	But from da beginning of creation 'he made them male n female.
Mk 10:7	Cuz of dis a man will leave his dad n mom n gonna be joined 2 his wife,
Mk 10:8	n da 2 will become 1 flesh,' so dat they’re no longer 2 but 1 flesh.
Mk 10:9	So wut God haz joined together, man must not separate." 

Mk 10:10	And in da house again da homeboys began 2 ask him 'bout dis.
Mk 10:11	And he said 2 them, "Whoever divorces his wife n marries anotha cheats against her.
Mk 10:12	And if she divorces her husband n marries anotha, she cheats." 

Mk 10:13	And they were bringing yung kids 2 him so dat he could touch them, but da homeboys roasted them.
Mk 10:14	But when Jesus saw it, he wuz indignant, n said 2 them, "Let da yung kids come 2 me. Don’t forbid them, 4 2 such belongs da kingdom of God.
Mk 10:15	TBH, whoever doesn't welcome da kingdom of God like a yung kid will never enter into it."
Mk 10:16	And after taking them into his arms, he blessed them, placing his hands on them. 

Mk 10:17	And as he wuz setting out on his wey, 1 individual ran up n knelt down b4 him n asked him, "Gud Teacher, wut must i do so dat i’ll inherit lyf 4ever?"
Mk 10:18	So Jesus said 2 him, "Y do u call me gud? No 1 is gud except God alone.
Mk 10:19	U kno da rules: 'Don’t murder, don’t cheat, don’t steal, don’t give false testimony, don’t defraud, honor yo dad n mom.'"
Mk 10:20	And he said 2 him, "Teacher, all deez i’ve observed from my youth."
Mk 10:21	And Jesus, looking at him, luvd him, n said 2 him, "U lack 1 thang: Go, sell all dat u hav, n give da proceeds 2 da poor--n u will hav treasure in heaven--n come, follow me."
Mk 10:22	But he looked gloomy at da statement n went away sad, cuz he had many possessions. 

Mk 10:23	And Jesus looked around n said 2 his homies, "How difficult it’s 4 those who possess wealth 2 enter into da kingdom of God!"
Mk 10:24	And da homeboys were astounded at his words. But Jesus answered n said 2 them again, "Kids, how difficult it’s 2 enter into da kingdom of God!
Mk 10:25	It’s easier 4 a camel 2 go thru da eye of a needle than 4 a rich person 2 enter into da kingdom of God."
Mk 10:26	And they were astounded af, sayin’ 2 1 anotha, "And who can be saved?"
Mk 10:27	Jesus looked at them n said, "Wit human beings it’s impossible, but not w God. Cuz all tingz r possible w God."
Mk 10:28	Pete began 2 tell him, "Look, we've left everythin’ n followed u."
Mk 10:29	Jesus said, "TBH, there’s nobody who haz left house or bros or sisters or mom or dad or kids or fields on account of me n on account of da gospel
Mk 10:30	who won’t get a hundred times as much now in dis time--houses n bros n sisters n mothers n kids n fields, together w persecutions--n in da age 2 come, lyf 4ever.
Mk 10:31	But many who r 1st gonna be last, n da last 1st." 

Mk 10:32	Now they were on da road goin’ up 2 Jerusalem, n Jesus wuz goin’ on ahead of them. And they were astounded, but those who were following him were afraid. And taking aside da 12 again, he began 2 tell them da tingz dat were 'bout 2 happen 2 him:
Mk 10:33	"Look, we're goin’ up 2 Jerusalem, n da Son of Man gonna be handed over 2 da chief priests n da scribes, n they’ll condemn him 2 death n will hand him over 2 da Gentiles.
Mk 10:34	And they’ll roast him n spit on him n whip him n kill him, n after 3 days he’ll rise." 

Mk 10:35	And James n Johnny, da sons of Zebedee, came up 2 him n said 2 him, "Teacher, we want u 2 do 4 us whatever we ask u."
Mk 10:36	And he said 2 them, "Wut do u want dat i do 4 u?"
Mk 10:37	So they said 2 him, "Grant 2 us dat we may sit 1 at yo right hand n 1 at yo left in yo glory."
Mk 10:38	But Jesus said 2 them, "U dunno wut u r asking! R u able 2 drink da cup dat i drink, or 2 be baptized w da baptism dat im baptized w?"
Mk 10:39	And they said 2 him, "We r able." So Jesus said 2 them, "U will drink da cup dat i drink, n u gonna be baptized w da baptism dat im baptized w,
Mk 10:40	but 2 sit at my right hand or at my left isn’t mine 2 grant, but is 4 those 4 whom it’s been prepared."
Mk 10:41	And when they heard dis, da 10 began 2 be indignant 'bout James n Johnny.
Mk 10:42	And Jesus called them 2 himself n said 2 them, "U kno dat those who r considered 2 rule over da Gentiles lord it over them, n their ppl in high positions exercise authority over them.
Mk 10:43	But it isn’t like dis among u! But whoever wants 2 become great among u gotta be yo servant,
Mk 10:44	n whoever wants 2 be most prominent among u gotta be da slave of all.
Mk 10:45	Cuz even da Son of Man didn't come 2 be served, but 2 serve, n 2 give his lyf as a ransom 4 many." 

Mk 10:46	And they came 2 Jericho. And as he wuz setting out from Jericho along w his homies n a large crowd, a blind beggar, Bartimaeus da son of Timaeus, wuz sitting beside da road.
Mk 10:47	And when he heard dat 'twas Jesus da Nazarene, he began 2 cri out n say, "Jesus, Son of Dave, hav mercy on me!"
Mk 10:48	And many ppl warned him dat he shud be quiet. But he wuz crying out even more loudly, "Son of Dave, hav mercy on me!"
Mk 10:49	And Jesus stopped n said, "Call him." And they called da blind man n said 2 him, "Hav courage! Get up! He is calling u."
Mk 10:50	And he yote off his cloak, jumped up, n came 2 Jesus.
Mk 10:51	And Jesus answered him n said, "Wut do u want me 2 do 4 u?" And da blind man said 2 him, "Rabboni, dat i may regain my sight."
Mk 10:52	And Jesus said 2 him, "Go, yo faith haz healed u." And immediately he regained his sight n began 2 follow him on da road. 


CHAPTER 11
Mk 11:1	And when they came near 2 Jerusalem, 2 Bethphage n Bethany at da Mount of Olives, he sent 2 of his homies
Mk 11:2	n said 2 them, "Go into da village b4 u, n right away as u enter into it u will find a colt tied, on which nobody haz ever sat. Untie it n bring it.
Mk 11:3	And if anyone says 2 u, 'Y r u doin’ dis?' say 'Da Lord haz need of it, n will send it here again at once.'"
Mk 11:4	And they went away n found a colt tied at a door outside in da street, n they untied it.
Mk 11:5	And some of those who were standing there said 2 them, "Wut r u doin’, untying da colt?"
Mk 11:6	So they told them, just like Jesus had said, n they allowed them 2 take it.
Mk 11:7	And they brought da colt 2 Jesus n yote their cloaks over it, n he sat on it.
Mk 11:8	And many ppl spread their cloaks on da road, n others spread leafy branches they had cut from da fields.
Mk 11:9	And those who went ahead n those who were following were shouting, 
 "Hosanna! Blessed is da 1 who comes in da name of da Lord!
Mk 11:10	Blessed is da comin’ kingdom of our dad Dave! Hosanna in da highest heaven!"

Mk 11:11	And he went into Jerusalem 2 da temple, n after looking around at everythin’, cuz da hr wuz already late, he went out 2 Bethany w da 12. 

Mk 11:12	And on da next day as they were departing from Bethany, he wuz hungry.
Mk 11:13	And when he saw from a distance a fig tree dat had leaves, he went 2 c if maybe he’d find anythin’ on it. And when he came up 2 it he found nothin’ except leaves, cuz 'twas not da season 4 figs.
Mk 11:14	And he responded n said 2 it, "Let nobody eat fruit from u any more 4ever!" And his homies heard it. 

Mk 11:15	And they came 2 Jerusalem. And he entered into da temple courts n began 2 drive out those who were selling n those who were buying in da temple courts, n overturned da tables of da money changers n da chairs of those who were selling doves.
Mk 11:16	And he didn't permit anyone 2 carry objects thru da temple courts.
Mk 11:17	And he began 2 teach n wuz sayin’ 2 them, "Is it not written, 
 'My house gonna be called a house of prayer 4 all da nations,'
 but u hav made it a cave of robbers!"
Mk 11:18	And da chief priests n da scribes heard it, n began considering how they could destroy him. Cuz they were afraid of him cuz da whole crowd wuz astounded by his teaching.
Mk 11:19	And when evening came they went out of da city. 

Mk 11:20	And as they passed by early in da mornin’, they saw da fig tree withered from da roots.
Mk 11:21	And Pete remembered n said 2 him, "Rabbi, look! Da fig tree dat u cursed haz withered!"
Mk 11:22	And Jesus answered n said 2 them, "Hav faith in God!
Mk 11:23	TBH whoever says 2 dis mountain, 'Be lifted up n yeeted into da sea!' n doesn't doubt in his heart, but believes dat wut he says will happen, it gonna be done 4 him.
Mk 11:24	Cuz of dis reason i tell u, whatever u pray n ask 4, believe dat u hav received it, n it gonna be done 4 u.
Mk 11:25	And whenever u stand praying, if u hav anythin’ against anyone, forgive him, so dat yo Dad who is in heaven will also forgive u yo sins." 

Mk 11:27	And they came again 2 Jerusalem. And as he wuz walking in da temple courts, da chief priests n da scribes n da elders came up 2 him
Mk 11:28	n said 2 him, "By wut authority r u doin’ deez tingz, or who gave u dis authority dat u do deez tingz?"
Mk 11:29	So Jesus said 2 them, "i’ll ask u 1 question. Answer me n i’ll tell u by wut authority im doin’ deez tingz.
Mk 11:30	Da baptism of Johnny--wuz it from heaven or from men? Answer me!"
Mk 11:31	And they began 2 discuss dis w 1 anotha, sayin’, "Wut shud we say? If we say 'From heaven,' he’ll say, 'Y then did u not believe him?'
Mk 11:32	But if we say, 'From men'"--they were afraid of da crowd, cuz they all looked on Johnny as fr a prophet.
Mk 11:33	And they replied 2 Jesus sayin’, "We dunno." And Jesus said 2 them, "Neither will i tell u by wut authority im doin’ deez tingz." 


CHAPTER 12
Mk 12:1	And he began 2 talk 2 them in parables: "A man planted a vineyard, n put a fence around it, n dug a trough 4 da winepress, n built a watchtower, n leased it 2 tenant farmers, n went on a journey.
Mk 12:2	And he sent a slave 2 da tenant farmers at da proper time, so dat he could collect some of da fruit of da vineyard from da tenant farmers.
Mk 12:3	And they seized him n beat him n sent him away empty-handed.
Mk 12:4	And again he sent 2 them anotha slave, n dat 1 they struck on da head n dishonored.
Mk 12:5	And he sent anotha, n dat 1 they killed. And he sent many others, some of whom they beat n some of whom they killed.
Mk 12:6	He had 1 more, a beloved son. Last of all he sent him 2 them, sayin’, 'They will respeck my son.'
Mk 12:7	But those tenant farmers said 2 1 anotha, 'Dis is da heir. Come, let’s kill him n da inheritance gonna be ours!'
Mk 12:8	And they seized n killed him n yote him out of da vineyard.
Mk 12:9	Wut will da owner of da vineyard do? He will come n destroy da tenant farmers n give da vineyard 2 others.
Mk 12:10	Hav u not read dis scripture: 
 'Da stone which da builders rejected, dis haz become da cornerstone.
Mk 12:11	Dis came 'bout from da Lord, n it’s marvelous in our eyes'?"

Mk 12:12	And they were seeking 2 arrest him, n they were afraid of da crowd, cuz they knew dat he had told da parable w reference 2 them. And they left him n went away. 

Mk 12:13	And they sent some of da Pharisees n da Herodians 2 him so dat they could catch him unawares in a statement.
Mk 12:14	And when they came, they said 2 him, "Teacher, we kno dat u r truthful n u don’t care wut anyone thinks, cuz u don’t regard da opinion of ppl but teach da wey of God in truth. Is it permitted 2 pay taxes 2 Caesar or not? Shud we pay or shud we not pay?"
Mk 12:15	But cuz he knew their hypocrisy, he said 2 them, "Y r u testing me? Bring me a denarius so dat i can look at it!"
Mk 12:16	So they brought 1. And he said 2 them, "Whose image n inscription is dis?" And they said 2 him, "Caesar's."
Mk 12:17	And Jesus said 2 them, "Give 2 Caesar da tingz of Caesar, n 2 God da tingz of God!" And they were utterly amazed at him. 

Mk 12:18	And Sadducees--who say there’s no resurrection--came up 2 him n began 2 ask him, sayin’,
Mk 12:19	"Teacher, Moe wrote 4 us dat if someone's bro dies n he leaves behind a wife n doesn't leave a kid, dat his bro shud take da wife n dad descendants 4 his bro.
Mk 12:20	There were 7 bros, n da 1st took a wife. And when he died, he didn't leave descendants.
Mk 12:21	And da 2nd took her, n he died without leaving descendants. And da 3rd like dat.
Mk 12:22	And da 7 didn't leave descendants. Last of all da woman also died.
Mk 12:23	In da resurrection, when they rise, whose wife will she be? Cuz da 7 had her as wife.
Mk 12:24	Jesus said 2 them, "R u not deceived cuz of dis, cuz u dunno da scriptures or da power of God?
Mk 12:25	Cuz when they rise from da ded, they neither marry nor r given in marriage, but r like angels in heaven.
Mk 12:26	Now abt da ded, dat they’re raised, hav u not read in da book of Moe in da passage 'bout da bush how God spoke 2 him, sayin’, 'im da God of Abe n da God of Isaac n da God of Jake'?
Mk 12:27	He isn’t God of da ded, but of da livin’. U r much af wrong!" 

Mk 12:28	And 1 of da scribes came up n heard them debating. When he saw dat he answered them well, he asked him, "Which rule is da most important of all?"
Mk 12:29	Jesus answered, "Da most important is, 'Listen, Israel! Da Lord our God, da Lord is 1.
Mk 12:30	And u will luv da Lord yo God from yo whole heart n from yo whole soul n from yo whole mind n from yo whole strength.'
Mk 12:31	Da 2nd is dis: 'U will luv yo bro as yoself.' There is no other rule better than deez."
Mk 12:32	And da scribe said 2 him, "Dat is tru, Teacher. U hav said correctly dat he’s 1 n there’s no other except him.
Mk 12:33	And 2 luv him from yo whole heart n from yo whole understanding n from yo whole strength, n 2 luv yo bro as yoself, is much more than all whole burnt offerings n sacrifices."
Mk 12:34	And Jesus, when he saw dat he had answered thoughtfully, said 2 him, "U aren’t far from da kingdom of God." And nobody dared 2 put a question 2 him any longer. 

Mk 12:35	And continuing, Jesus said while teaching in da temple courts, "How can da scribes say dat da Christ is Dave's son?
Mk 12:36	Dave himself said by da Holy Spirit, 
 'Da Lord said 2 my Lord, "Sit at my right hand, until i put yo enemies under yo feet." '

Mk 12:37	Dave himself calls him 'Lord,' n how’s he his son?" And da large crowd wuz listening 2 him gladly. 

Mk 12:38	And in his teaching he said, "Beware of da scribes, who like walking around in long robes n greetings in da marketplaces
Mk 12:39	n da best seats in da synagogues n da places of honor at banquets,
Mk 12:40	who devour da houses of widows n pray lengthy prayers 4 da sake of appearance. Deez will get more severe condemnation!" 

Mk 12:41	And he sat down opposite da contribution box n wuz observing how da crowd wuz putting coins into da contribution box. And many rich ppl were putting in many coins.
Mk 12:42	And 1 poor widow came n put in 2 smol copper coins (dat’s, a penny).
Mk 12:43	And summoning his homeboys, he said 2 them, "TBH dis poor widow put in more than all those who put offerings into da contribution box.
Mk 12:44	Cuz they all contributed out of their abundance, but she out of her poverty put in everythin’ she had, her whole means of subsistence." 


CHAPTER 13
Mk 13:1	And as he wuz goin’ out of da temple courts, 1 of his homies said 2 him, "Teacher, look! Wut great stones n wut wonderful buildings!"
Mk 13:2	And Jesus said 2 him, "Do u c deez great buildings? Not 1 stone gonna be left here on anotha stone dat’ll not be yeeted down!" 

Mk 13:3	And as he wuz sitting on da Mount of Olives opposite da temple, Pete n James n Johnny n Andrew asked him privately,
Mk 13:4	"Tell us, when will deez tingz happen, n wut gonna be da sign when all deez tingz r 'bout 2 be accomplished?"
Mk 13:5	So Jesus began 2 tell them, "Watch out dat nobody deceives u!
Mk 13:6	Many will come in my name, sayin’, 'im he,' n they’ll deceive many.
Mk 13:7	And when u hear 'bout wars n rumors of wars, don’t be alarmed. Dis must happen, but da end isn’t yet.
Mk 13:8	Cuz nation will rise up against nation n kingdom against kingdom. There gonna be earthquakes in various places. There gonna be famines. Deez tingz r da beginning of birth pains. 

Mk 13:9	"But u, watch out 4 yoselves! They will hand u over 2 councils n u gonna be beaten in da synagogues n will hav 2 stand b4 governors n kings cuz of me, 4 a witness 2 them.
Mk 13:10	And da gospel must 1st be proclaimed 2 all da nations.
Mk 13:11	And when they arrest u n hand u over, don’t be trippin’ beforehand wut u shud say, but whatever is given 2 u at dat hr, say dis. Cuz u aren’t da ones who r talkin’, but da Holy Spirit.
Mk 13:12	And bro will hand over bro 2 death, n a dad his kid, n kids will rise up against parents n hav them put 2 death.
Mk 13:13	And u gonna be hated by all cuz of my name. But da 1 who endures 2 da end--dis 1 gonna be saved. 

Mk 13:14	"But when u c da abomination of desolation standing where it shouldn’t be" (let da 1 who reads understand), "then those in Judea must flee 2 da mountains!
Mk 13:15	Da 1 who is on his housetop must not come down or go inside 2 take anythin’ out of his house,
Mk 13:16	n da 1 who is in da field must not turn back 2 pick up his cloak.
Mk 13:17	And woe 2 those who r preggers n 2 those who r nursing their babies in those days!
Mk 13:18	But pray dat it’ll not happen in winter.
Mk 13:19	Cuz in those days there gonna be tribulation of such a kind as hasn't happened from da beginning of da creation dat God created until now, n never will happen.
Mk 13:20	And if da Lord hadn't shortened da days, no human bein’ would be saved. But 4 da sake of da elect, whom he chose, he’s shortened da days. 

Mk 13:21	"And at dat time if anyone shud tell u, "Look, here is da Christ,' 'Look, there he’s,' don’t believe him!
Mk 13:22	Cuz false messiahs n false prophets will appear, n will produce signs n wonders in order 2 mislead, if possible, da elect.
Mk 13:23	But u, watch out! i’ve told u everythin’ ahead of time! 

Mk 13:24	"But in those days, after dat tribulation, 
 'da sun gonna be darkened n da moon won’t give its light,
Mk 13:25	n da stars gonna be falling from heaven, n da powers in da heavens gonna be shaken.'

Mk 13:26	And then they’ll c da Son of Man arriving in da clouds w great power n glory.
Mk 13:27	And then he’ll send out da angels, n will gather da elect together from da 4 winds, from da end of da earth 2 da end of heaven. 

Mk 13:28	"Now learn da parable from da fig tree: Whenever its branch haz already become tender n puts forth its leaves, u kno dat summer is near.
Mk 13:29	So also u, when u c deez tingz happening, kno dat he’s near, at da door.
Mk 13:30	TBH dis generation will never pass away until all deez tingz take place!
Mk 13:31	Heaven n earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away. 

Mk 13:32	"But abt dat day or hr nobody knows--not even da angels in heaven nor da Son--except da Dad.
Mk 13:33	Watch out! Be alert, cuz u dunno when da time is!
Mk 13:34	It’s like a man away on a journey, who left his house n gave his slaves authority--2 each 1 his work--n 2 da doorkeeper he gave orders dat he shud be on da alert.
Mk 13:35	So be on da alert, 4 u dunno when da master of da house is comin’--whether in da evening, or at midnight, or when da rooster crows, or early in da mornin’--
Mk 13:36	lest he arrive suddenly n find u sleeping.
Mk 13:37	And wut i tell u, i tell e’erybody: Be on da alert!" 


CHAPTER 14
Mk 14:1	Now after 2 days 'twas da Passover n da feast of Unleavened Bread, n da chief priests n da scribes were seeking how, after arresting him by stealth, they could kill him.
Mk 14:2	Cuz they said, "Not at da feast, lest there be an uproar by da ppl." 

Mk 14:3	And while he wuz at Bethany in da house of Simon da leper, as he wuz reclining 4 a meal, a woman came holding an alabaster flask of costly af perfumed oil of genuine nard. After breaking da alabaster flask, she poured it out on his head.
Mk 14:4	But some were expressing indignation 2 1 anotha: "Y haz there been dis waste of perfumed oil?
Mk 14:5	Cuz of dis perfumed oil could've been sold 4 more than 3 hundred denarii n given 2 da poor!" And they began 2 scold her.
Mk 14:6	But Jesus said, "Leave her alone. Y do u cause trouble 4 her? She haz done a gud deed 2 me.
Mk 14:7	Cuz da poor u always hav w u, n u can do gud 4 them whenever u want, but u don’t always hav me.
Mk 14:8	She haz done wut she could; she’s anointed my body beforehand 4 burial.
Mk 14:9	And tbh, wherever da gospel is proclaimed in da whole world, wut she’s done will also be told in memory of her. 

Mk 14:10	And Judas Iscariot, who wuz 1 of da 12, went 2 da chief priests in order 2 betray him 2 them.
Mk 14:11	And when they heard dis, they were delighted, n promised 2 give him money. And he began seeking how he could betray him conveniently. 

Mk 14:12	And on da 1st day of da feast of Unleavened Bread, when they sacrificed da Passover lamb, his homeboys said 2 him, "Where do u want us 2 go n prepare, so dat u can eat da Passover?"
Mk 14:13	And he sent 2 of his homies n said 2 them, "Go into da city n a man carrying a jar of water will meet u. Follow him,
Mk 14:14	n wherever he enters, tell da master of da house, 'Da Teacher says, "Where is my guest room where i may eat da Passover w my homies?" '
Mk 14:15	And he’ll show u a large upstairs room furnished n ready, n prepare 4 us there."
Mk 14:16	And da homeboys went out n came into da city n found everythin’ just like he had told them, n they prepared da Passover. 

Mk 14:17	And when 'twas evening, he arrived w da 12.
Mk 14:18	And while they were reclining at table n eating, Jesus said, "TBH, dat 1 of u who is eating w me will betray me."
Mk 14:19	They began 2 be distressed n 2 tell him 1 by 1, "Ofc not i?"
Mk 14:20	But he said 2 them, "It’s 1 of da 12--da 1 who is dipping bread into da bowl w me.
Mk 14:21	Cuz da Son of Man is goin’ just like it’s written 'bout him, but woe 2 dat man by whom da Son of Man is betrayed! It would be better 4 him if dat man hadn't been born." 

Mk 14:22	And while they were eating, he took bread n, after giving thanks, he broke it n gave it 2 them n said, "Take it, dis is my body."
Mk 14:23	And after taking da cup n giving thanks, he gave it 2 them, n they all drank from it.
Mk 14:24	And he said 2 them, "Dis is my blood of da covenant which is poured out 4 many.
Mk 14:25	TBH i’ll never drink of da fruit of da vine any longer until dat day when i drink it new in da kingdom of God."
Mk 14:26	And after they had sung da hymn, they went out 2 da Mount of Olives. 

Mk 14:27	And Jesus said 2 them, "U will all fall away, cuz it’s written, 
 'i’ll hit da shepherd n da sheep gonna be scattered.'

Mk 14:28	But after im raised, i’ll go ahead of u into Galilee."
Mk 14:29	But Pete said 2 him, "Even if they all fall away, totally i’ll not!"
Mk 14:30	And Jesus said 2 him, "TBH 2day--dis night--b4 da rooster crows twice, u will deny me 3 times!"
Mk 14:31	But he kept sayin’ emphatically, "If it’s necessary 4 me 2 die w u, i’ll never deny u!" And they all were sayin’ da same thang also. 

Mk 14:32	And they came 2 a place named Gethsemane, n he said 2 his homies, "Sit here while i pray."
Mk 14:33	And he took along Pete n James n Johnny w him, n he began 2 be distressed n troubled.
Mk 14:34	And he said 2 them, "My soul is deeply grieved, 2 da point of death. Remain here n stay awake."
Mk 14:35	And goin’ forward a lil’ he fell 2 da ground n began 2 pray dat, if it were possible, da hr would pass from him.
Mk 14:36	And he said, "Abba, Dad, all tingz r possible 4 u! Take away dis cup from me! Yet not wut i’ll, but wut u will."
Mk 14:37	And he came n found them sleeping, n he said 2 Pete, "Simon, r u sleeping? Were u not able 2 stay awake 1 hr?
Mk 14:38	Stay awake n pray dat u won’t enter into temptation. Da spirit is willing, but da flesh is weak!"
Mk 14:39	And again he went away n prayed, sayin’ da same thang.
Mk 14:40	And again he came n found them sleeping, 4 they couldn't keep their eyes open, n they didn't kno wut 2 reply 2 him.
Mk 14:41	And he came da 3rd time n said 2 them, "R u still sleeping n resting? It’s enough! Da hr haz come. Look, da Son of Man is bein’ betrayed into da hands of sinners.
Mk 14:42	Get up, let’s go! Look, da 1 who is betraying me is approaching!" 

Mk 14:43	And immediately, while he wuz still talkin’, Judas--1 of da 12--arrived, n w him a crowd w swords n clubs, from da chief priests n da scribes n da elders.
Mk 14:44	Now da 1 who wuz betraying him had given them a sign, sayin’, "Da 1 whom i kiss--he’s da 1. Arrest him n lead him away under guard!"
Mk 14:45	And when he arrived, he came up 2 him immediately n said, "Rabbi," n kissed him.
Mk 14:46	So they laid hands on him n arrested him. 

Mk 14:47	But a certain 1 of da bystanders, drawing his sword, struck da slave of da high priest n cut off his ear.
Mk 14:48	And Jesus answered n said 2 them, "Hav u come out w swords n clubs, as against a robber, 2 arrest me?
Mk 14:49	Every day i wuz w u in da temple courts teaching, n u didn't arrest me! But dis haz happened so dat da scriptures would be fulfilled.
Mk 14:50	And they all abandoned him n fled. 

Mk 14:51	And a certain yung man wuz following him, clothed only in a linen cloth on his nude body. And they attempted 2 seize him,
Mk 14:52	but he left behind da linen cloth n fled nude. 

Mk 14:53	And they led Jesus away 2 da high priest, n all da chief priests n da elders n da scribes came together.
Mk 14:54	And Pete followed him from a distance, right inside, into da courtyard of da high priest. And he wuz sitting w da officers n warming himself by da fire.
Mk 14:55	Now da chief priests n da whole Sanhedrin were looking 4 testimony against Jesus in order 2 put him 2 death, n they didn't find it.
Mk 14:56	Cuz many gave false testimony against him, n their testimony wasn’t consistent.
Mk 14:57	And some stood up n began 2 give false testimony against him, sayin’,
Mk 14:58	"We heard him sayin’, 'i’ll destroy dis temple made by hands, n within 3 days i’ll build anotha not made by hands."
Mk 14:59	And their testimony wasn’t even consistent 'bout dis.
Mk 14:60	And da high priest stood up in da midst of them n asked Jesus, sayin’, "Do u not reply anythin’? Wut r deez ppl testifying against u?"
Mk 14:61	But he wuz silent n didn't reply anythin’. Again da high priest asked him n said 2 him, "R u da Christ, da Son of da Blessed 1?"
Mk 14:62	And Jesus said, "im, n u will c da Son of Man sitting at da right hand of da Power n comin’ w da clouds of heaven."
Mk 14:63	And da high priest tore his clothes n said, "Wut further need do we've of witnesses?
Mk 14:64	U hav heard da blasphemy! Wut do u think?" And they all condemned him as deserving death.
Mk 14:65	And some began 2 spit on him n 2 cover his face n 2 hit him w their fists, n 2 tell him "Prophesy!" And da officers received him w slaps in da face. 

Mk 14:66	And while Pete wuz below in da courtyard, 1 of da female slaves of da high priest came up
Mk 14:67	And when she saw Pete warming himself, she looked intently at him n said, "U also were w da Nazarene, Jesus."
Mk 14:68	But he denied it, sayin’, "i neither kno nor understand wut u mean!" And he went out into da gateway, n a rooster crowed.
Mk 14:69	And da female slave, when she saw him, began 2 say again 2 da bystanders, "Dis man is 1 of them!"
Mk 14:70	But he denied it again. And after a lil’ while, again da bystanders began 2 tell Pete, "U rly r 1 of them, cuz u also r a Galilean, n yo accent shows it!"
Mk 14:71	And he began 2 curse n 2 swear w an oath, "idk dis man whom u r talking 'bout!"
Mk 14:72	And immediately a rooster crowed 4 da 2nd time. And Pete remembered da statement, how Jesus had said 2 him, "B4 da rooster crows twice, u will deny me 3 times," n throwing himself down, he began 2 cri. 


CHAPTER 15
Mk 15:1	And as soon as mornin’ came, after formulating a plan, da chief priests, w da elders n scribes n da whole Sanhedrin, tied up Jesus, led him away, n handed him over 2 Pilate.
Mk 15:2	And Pilate asked him, "R u da king of da Jews?" And he answered him n said, "U say so."
Mk 15:3	And da chief priests began 2 accuse him of many tingz.
Mk 15:4	So Pilate asked him again, sayin’, "Do u not answer anythin’? C how many charges they’re bringing against u!"
Mk 15:5	But Jesus didn't answer anythin’ further, so dat Pilate wuz shook. 

Mk 15:6	Now at each feast he customarily released 4 them 1 prisoner whom they requested.
Mk 15:7	And da 1 named Barabbas wuz imprisoned w da rebels who had committed murder in da rebellion.
Mk 15:8	And da crowd came up n began 2 ask him 2 do as he customarily did 4 them.
Mk 15:9	So Pilate answered them, sayin’, "Do u want me 2 release 4 u da king of da Jews?"
Mk 15:10	(Cuz he realized dat da chief priests had handed him over cuz of envy.)
Mk 15:11	But da chief priests incited da crowd so dat he’d release 4 them Barabbas instead.
Mk 15:12	So Pilate answered n said 2 them again, "Then wut do u want me 2 do w da 1 whom u call da king of da Jews?"
Mk 15:13	And they shouted again, "Crucify him!"
Mk 15:14	And Pilate said 2 them, "Y? Wut bad haz he done?" But they shouted even louder, "Crucify him!" 

Mk 15:15	So Pilate, cuz he wanted 2 satisfy da crowd, released 4 them Barabbas. And after he had Jesus whipped, he handed him over so dat he could be crucified. 

Mk 15:16	So da soldiers led him away into da palace (dat’s, da governor's rez) n called together da whole cohort.
Mk 15:17	And they put a purple cloak on him, n after weaving a crown of thorns they placed it on him.
Mk 15:18	And they began 2 greet him, "Hail, king of da Jews!"
Mk 15:19	And they repeatedly struck him on da head w a reed, n were spitting on him, n they knelt down n did obeisance 2 him.
Mk 15:20	And when they had roasted him, they stripped him of da purple cloak n put his own clothes on him, n they led him out so dat they could crucify him. 

Mk 15:21	And they forced a certain man who wuz passing by, Simon of Cyrene (da dad of Alexander n Rufus), who wuz comin’ from da country, 2 carry his cross.
Mk 15:22	And they brought him 2 da place Golgotha (which is translated "Place of a Skull").
Mk 15:23	And they attempted 2 give him wine mixed w myrrh, but he didn't take it.
Mk 15:24	And they crucified him n divided his clothes among themselves by casting lots 4 them 2 c who shud take wut.
Mk 15:25	Now 'twas da 3rd hr when they crucified him.
Mk 15:26	And da inscription of da charge against him wuz written, "Da king of da Jews."
Mk 15:27	And w him they crucified 2 robbers, 1 on his right n 1 on his left.
Mk 15:29	And those who passed by reviled him, shaking their heads n sayin’, "Aha! Da 1 who’d destroy da temple n rebuild it in 3 days,
Mk 15:30	save yoself by comin’ down from da cross!"
Mk 15:31	In da same wey also da chief priests, along w da scribes, were roasting him 2 1 anotha, sayin’, "He saved others; he’s not able 2 save himself!
Mk 15:32	Let da Christ, da king of Israel, come down now from da cross, so dat we may c n believe! Even those who were crucified w him were reviling him. 

Mk 15:33	And when da 6th hr came, darkness came over da whole land until da 9th hr.
Mk 15:34	And at da 9th hr Jesus cried out w a loud voice, "Eloi, Eloi, lema sabachthani?" (which is translated, "My God, my God, y hav u forsaken me?")
Mk 15:35	And some of da bystanders, when they heard it, said, "Look, he’s summoning Elijah!"
Mk 15:36	And someone ran n filled a sponge w sour wine, put it on a reed, n gave it 2 him 2 drink, sayin’, "Leave him alone! Let us c if Elijah is comin’ 2 take him down."
Mk 15:37	But Jesus uttered a loud cri n expired.
Mk 15:38	And da curtain of da temple wuz torn in 2 from top 2 bottom.
Mk 15:39	And when da centurion who wuz standing opposite him saw dat he expired like dis, he said, "Fr dis man wuz God's Son!"
Mk 15:40	And there were also women observing from a distance, among whom were Mary Magdalene, n Mary da mom of James da younger n Joses, n Salome,
Mk 15:41	who used 2 follow him n serve him when he wuz in Galilee, n many other women who went up w him 2 Jerusalem.

Mk 15:43	Joey of Arimathea, a prominent member of da council who wuz also himself looking forward 2 da kingdom of God, came acting courageously n went in 2 Pilate n asked 4 da body of Jesus.
Mk 15:44	And Pilate wuz shook dat he wuz already ded, n summoning da centurion, asked him whether he had died already.
Mk 15:45	And when he learned of it from da centurion, he granted da corpse 2 Joey.
Mk 15:46	And after purchasing a linen cloth n taking him down, he wrapped him in da linen cloth n placed him in a tomb dat had been cut from da rock. And he rolled a stone over da entrance of da tomb.
Mk 15:47	Now Mary Magdalene n Mary da mom of Joses saw where he wuz placed. 


CHAPTER 16
Mk 16:1	And when da Sabbath wuz over, Mary Magdalene, n Mary da mom of James, n Salome purchased fragrant spices so dat they could go n anoint him.
Mk 16:2	And very early in da mornin’ on da 1st day of da week they came 2 da tomb after da sun had risen.
Mk 16:3	And they were sayin’ 2 1 anotha, "Who will roll away da stone 4 us from da entrance of da tomb?"
Mk 16:4	And when they looked up, they saw dat da stone had been rolled away (4 'twas large af).
Mk 16:5	And as they were goin’ into da tomb, they saw a yung man dressed in a white robe sitting on da right side, n they were alarmed.
Mk 16:6	But he said 2 them, "Don’t be alarmed. U r looking 4 Jesus da Nazarene who wuz crucified. He haz been raised, he’s not here! C da place where they laid him!
Mk 16:7	But go, tell his homeboys n Pete dat he’s goin’ ahead of u 2 Galilee. U will c him there, just like he told u."
Mk 16:8	And they went out n fled from da tomb, cuz trembling n amazement had seized them. And they said nothin’ 2 anyone, cuz they were afraid. 

Mk 16:9	Now early on da 1st day of da week, after he rose, he appeared 1st 2 Mary Magdalene, from whom he had expelled 7 demons.
Mk 16:10	She went out n announced it 2 those who were w him while they were mourning n weepin’.
Mk 16:11	And those, when they heard dat he wuz alive n had been seen by her, refused 2 believe it.
Mk 16:12	And after deez tingz, he appeared in a different form 2 2 of them as they were walking, while they were goin’ out into da countryside.
Mk 16:13	And deez went n reported it 2 da others, n they didn't believe them.
Mk 16:14	And later, while they were reclining at table, he appeared 2 da 11. And he reprimanded their unbelief n hardness of heart, cuz they didn't believe those who had seen him after he had been raised.
Mk 16:15	And he said 2 them, "Go into all da world n preach da gospel 2 all creation.
Mk 16:16	Da 1 who believes n is baptized gonna be saved, but da 1 who refuses 2 believe gonna be condemned.
Mk 16:17	And deez signs will accompany those who believe: in my name they’ll expel demons, they’ll talk in new tongues,
Mk 16:18	they’ll pick up sneks. And if they drink any deadly poison it’ll never hurt them; they’ll lay hands on da sick n they’ll get well." 

Mk 16:19	Then da Lord Jesus, after he had spoken 2 them, wuz taken up into heaven n sat down at da right hand of God.
Mk 16:20	And they went out n proclaimed everywhere, while da Lord wuz working together w them n confirming da msg thru da accompanying signs.]]
