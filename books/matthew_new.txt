CHAPTER 1
Mt 1:1	Da book of da genealogy of JC, da son of Dave, da son of Abe. 

Mt 1:2	Abe became da dad of Isaac, n Isaac became da dad of Jake, n Jake became da dad of Judah n his bros,
Mt 1:3	n Judah became da dad of Perez n Zerah by Tamar, n Perez became da dad of Hezron, n Hezron became da dad of Aram,
Mt 1:4	n Aram became da dad of Amminadab, n Amminadab became da dad of Nahshon, n Nahshon became da dad of Salmon,
Mt 1:5	n Salmon became da dad of Boaz by Rahab, n Boaz became da dad of Obed by Ruth, n Obed became da dad of Jesse,
Mt 1:6	n Jesse became da dad of Dave da king. 
 And Dave became da dad of Solomon by da wife of Uriah,
Mt 1:7	n Solomon became da dad of Rehoboam, n Rehoboam became da dad of Abijah, n Abijah became da dad of Asa,
Mt 1:8	n Asa became da dad of Jehoshaphat, n Jehoshaphat became da dad of Joram, n Joram became da dad of Uzziah,
Mt 1:9	n Uzziah became da dad of Jotham, n Jotham became da dad of Ahaz, n Ahaz became da dad of Hezekiah,
Mt 1:10	n Hezekiah became da dad of Manasseh, n Manasseh became da dad of Amon, n Amon became da dad of Josiah,
Mt 1:11	n Josiah became da dad of Jechoniah n his bros, at da time of da deportation 2 Babylon. 

Mt 1:12	And after da deportation 2 Babylon, Jechoniah became da dad of Shealtiel, n Shealtiel became da dad of Zerubbabel,
Mt 1:13	n Zerubbabel became da dad of Abiud, n Abiud became da dad of Eliakim, n Eliakim became da dad of Azor,
Mt 1:14	n Azor became da dad of Zadok, n Zadok became da dad of Achim, n Achim became da dad of Eliud,
Mt 1:15	n Eliud became da dad of Eleazar, n Eleazar became da dad of Matthan, n Matthan became da dad of Jake,
Mt 1:16	n Jake became da dad of Joey, da husband of Mary by whom wuz born Jesus, who is called Christ. 

Mt 1:17	So all da gens from Abe 2 Dave r 14 gens, n from Dave 2 da deportation 2 Babylon r 14 gens, n from da deportation 2 Babylon 2 da Christ r 14 gens. 

Mt 1:18	Now da birth of JC occurred in dis wey. His mom Mary had been betrothed 2 Joey, but b4 they came together, she wuz found 2 be preggers by da Holy Spirit.
Mt 1:19	So Joey her husband, bein’ gud n not wanting 2 disgrace her, planned 2 divorce her secretly.
Mt 1:20	But as he wuz considering deez tingz, look, an angel of da Lord appeared 2 him in a dream, sayin’, "Joey, son of Dave, don’t be afraid 2 take Mary as yo wife, 4 wut haz been conceived in her is from da Holy Spirit.
Mt 1:21	And she’ll give birth 2 a son, n u will call his name 'Jesus,' cuz he’ll save his ppl from their sins."
Mt 1:22	Now all dis happened so dat wut wuz spoken by da Lord thru da prophet would be fulfilled, sayin’, 

Mt 1:23	"Look, da virgin will become preggers n will give birth 2 a son, n they’ll call his name Eman,"
 which is translated, "God w us."
Mt 1:24	And Joey, when he woke up from sleep, did as da angel of da Lord commanded him, n he took his wife
Mt 1:25	n didn't hav sexy times w her until she gave birth 2 a son. And he called his name Jesus. 


CHAPTER 2
Mt 2:1	Now after Jesus wuz born in Bethlehem of Judea in da days of Herod da king, look, woke men from da east came 2 Jerusalem,
Mt 2:2	sayin’, "Where is da 1 who haz been born king of da Jews? Cuz we've seen his star at its rising n hav come 2 worship him."
Mt 2:3	And when King Herod heard it, he wuz troubled, n all Jerusalem w him,
Mt 2:4	n after calling together all da chief priests n scribes of da ppl, he inquired from them where da Christ wuz 2 be born.
Mt 2:5	So they said 2 him, "In Bethlehem of Judea, 4 so it’s written by da prophet, 

Mt 2:6	'And u, Bethlehem, land of Judah, r by no means least among da rulers of Judah, 4 from u will go out a ruler who will shepherd my ppl Israel.'"

Mt 2:7	Then Herod secretly summoned da woke men n determined precisely from them da time when da star appeared.
Mt 2:8	And he sent them 2 Bethlehem n said, "Go, inquire carefully abt da kid, n when u hav found him, report 2 me so dat i also may come n worship him."
Mt 2:9	After they listened 2 da king, they went out, n look, da star which they had seen at its rising led them until it came n stood above da place where da kid wuz.
Mt 2:10	Now when they saw da star, they rejoiced w great af happiness.
Mt 2:11	And when they came into da house, they saw da kid w Mary his mom, n they fell down n worshiped him. And opening their treasure boxes, they offered him gifts of gold n frankincense n myrrh.
Mt 2:12	And bein’ warned in a dream not 2 return 2 Herod, they went back 2 their own country by anotha route. 

Mt 2:13	Now after they had gone away, look, an angel of da Lord appeared in a dream 2 Joey, sayin’, "Get up, take da kid n his mom n flee 2 Egypt, n stay there until i tell u. Cuz Herod is 'bout 2 seek da kid 2 destroy him."
Mt 2:14	So he got up n took da kid n his mom during da night n went away 2 Egypt.
Mt 2:15	And he wuz there until da death of Herod, so dat wut wuz said by da Lord thru da prophet would be fulfilled, sayin’, 
 "Out of Egypt i called my son." 

Mt 2:16	Then Herod, when he saw dat he had been deceived by da woke men, became angry af, n he sent soldiers n executed all da kids in Bethlehem n in all da region around it from da age of 2 yrs old n under, accordin’ 2 da time which he had determined precisely from da woke men.
Mt 2:17	Then wut wuz spoken by da prophet Jeremiah wuz fulfilled, sayin’, 

Mt 2:18	"A voice wuz heard in Ramah, weepin’ n great mourning, Rachel weepin’ 4 her kids, n she didn't wanna be comforted, cuz they exist no longer."

Mt 2:19	Now after Herod had died, look, an angel of da Lord appeared in a dream 2 Joey in Egypt,
Mt 2:20	sayin’, "Get up, take da kid n his mom n go 2 da land of Israel, 4 those who were seeking da lyf of da kid r ded."
Mt 2:21	So he got up n took da kid n his mom n entered da land of Israel.
Mt 2:22	But when he heard dat Archelaus wuz reigning over Judea in place of his dad Herod, he wuz afraid 2 go there, n bein’ warned in a dream, he took refuge in da regions of Galilee.
Mt 2:23	And he came n lived in a town called Nazareth, so dat wut wuz said by da prophets would be fulfilled: "He gonna be called a Nazarene." 


CHAPTER 3
Mt 3:1	Now in those days Johnny da Baptist came preaching in da Judean wilderness
Mt 3:2	n sayin’, "Repent, 4 da kingdom of heaven haz come near!"
Mt 3:3	Cuz of dis is da 1 who wuz spoken 'bout by da prophet Isaiah, sayin’, 
 "Da voice of 1 crying out in da wilderness, 'Prepare da wae of da Lord, make his paths straight.'"

Mt 3:4	Now Johnny himself had his clothing made from camel's hair n a belt made of leather around his waist, n his food wuz locusts n wild honey.
Mt 3:5	Then Jerusalem n all Judea n all da district around da Jordan were goin’ out 2 him,
Mt 3:6	n they were bein’ baptized by him in da Jordan River as they confessed their sins. 

Mt 3:7	But when he saw many of da Pharisees n Sadducees comin’ 2 his baptism, he said 2 them, "Offspring of sneks! Who warned u 2 flee from da comin’ wrath?
Mt 3:8	So produce fruit worthy of repentance!
Mt 3:9	And don’t think 2 tell yoselves, 'We hav Abe as dad.' Cuz i tell u dat God is able 2 raise up kids 4 Abe from deez stones!
Mt 3:10	Already now da ax is positioned at da root of da trees; so every tree not producing gud fruit is cut down n yeeted into da fire.
Mt 3:11	i baptize u w water 4 repentance, but da 1 who comes after me is more powerful than im, whose sandals i ain’t worthy 2 carry. He will baptize u w da Holy Spirit n fire.
Mt 3:12	His winnowing shovel is in his hand, n he’ll clean out his threshing floor n will gather his wheat into da storehouse, but he’ll burn up da chaff w unquenchable fire." 

Mt 3:13	Then Jesus came from Galilee 2 da Jordan 2 Johnny in order 2 be baptized by him.
Mt 3:14	But Johnny tried 2 prevent him, sayin’, "i need 2 be baptized by u, n do u come 2 me?"
Mt 3:15	But Jesus answered n said 2 him, "Permit it now, 4 in dis wae it’s right 4 us 2 fulfill all righteousness." Then he permitted him.
Mt 3:16	Now after he wuz baptized, Jesus immediately went up from da water, n look, da heavens opened n he saw da Spirit of God goin’ down like a dove comin’ on him.
Mt 3:17	And look, there wuz a voice from heaven sayin’, "Dis is my beloved Son, w whom im well pleased." 


CHAPTER 4
Mt 4:1	Then Jesus wuz led up into da wilderness by da Spirit 2 be tempted by da devil,
Mt 4:2	n after he had fasted forty days n forty nights, then he wuz hungry.
Mt 4:3	And da tempter approached n said 2 him, "If u r da Son of God, order dat deez stones become bread."
Mt 4:4	But he answered n said, "It’s written, 'Man won’t live on bread alone, but on every word dat comes out of da mouth of God." 

Mt 4:5	Then da devil took him 2 da holy city n placed him on da highest point of da temple
Mt 4:6	n said 2 him, "If u r da Son of God, yeet yoself down! Cuz it’s written, 
 'He will command his angels abt u,' 
 n 
 'On their hands they’ll lift u up, lest u hit yo foot against a stone.'"

Mt 4:7	Jesus said 2 him, "On da other hand it’s written, 'U aren’t 2 put da Lord yo God 2 da test.'" 

Mt 4:8	Again da devil took him 2 a very high mountain n showed him all da kingdoms of da world n their glory,
Mt 4:9	n he said 2 him, "i’ll give 2 u all deez tingz, if u will fall down n worship me."
Mt 4:10	Then Jesus said 2 him, "Go away, Satan, 4 it’s written, 'U will worship da Lord yo God n serve only him.'"
Mt 4:11	Then da devil left him, n look, angels came n began ministering 2 him. 

Mt 4:12	Now when he heard dat Johnny had been arrested, he withdrew into Galilee.
Mt 4:13	And leaving Nazareth, he went n lived in Capernaum by da sea, in da region of Zebulun n Naphtali,
Mt 4:14	so dat wut wuz spoken by da prophet Isaiah would be fulfilled, who said, 

Mt 4:15	"Land of Zebulun n land of Naphtali, toward da sea, on da other side of da Jordan, Galilee of da Gentiles--
Mt 4:16	da ppl who sit in darkness hav seen a great light, n da ones who sit in da land n shadow of death, a light haz dawned on them."

Mt 4:17	From dat time on, Jesus began 2 preach n 2 say, "Repent, cuz da kingdom of heaven is near." 

Mt 4:18	Now as he wuz walking beside da Sea of Galilee, he saw 2 bros, Simon called Pete n his bro Andrew, throwing a casting net into da sea (4 they were fishermen).
Mt 4:19	And he said 2 them, "Follow me n i’ll make u fishers of ppl."
Mt 4:20	And immediately they left their nets n followed him.
Mt 4:21	And goin’ on from there, he saw 2 other bros, James da son of Zebedee n his bro Johnny, in da boat w their dad Zebedee, mending their nets, n he called them.
Mt 4:22	And immediately they left da boat n their dad n followed him. 

Mt 4:23	And he went around thru all of Galilee, teaching in their synagogues n proclaiming da gud news of da kingdom n healing every disease n every sickness among da ppl.
Mt 4:24	And a report 'bout him went out throughout Syria, n they brought 2 him all those who were sick w various diseases n afflicted by torments, demon-possessed n epileptics n paralytics, n he healed them.
Mt 4:25	And large crowds followed him from Galilee, Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea, n from da other side of da Jordan. 


CHAPTER 5
Mt 5:1	Now when he saw da crowds, he went up da mountain n after he sat down, his homeboys approached him.
Mt 5:2	And opening his mouth he began 2 teach them, sayin’, 

Mt 5:3	"Blessed r da poor in spirit, cuz theirs is da kingdom of heaven.
Mt 5:4	Blessed r da ones who mourn, cuz they gonna be comforted.
Mt 5:5	Blessed r da meek, cuz they’ll inherit da earth.
Mt 5:6	Blessed r da ones who hunger n thirst 4 righteousness, cuz they gonna be satisfied.
Mt 5:7	Blessed r da merciful, cuz they gonna be shown mercy.
Mt 5:8	Blessed r da pure in heart, cuz they’ll c God.
Mt 5:9	Blessed r da peacemakers, cuz they gonna be called sons of God.
Mt 5:10	Blessed r those who r persecuted cuz of righteousness, cuz theirs is da kingdom of heaven.
Mt 5:11	Blessed r u when they roast u n persecute u n say all kinds of bad tingz against u, lying on account of me.
Mt 5:12	Rejoice n be glad, cuz yo reward is great in heaven, 4 in da same wey they persecuted da prophets b4 u.

Mt 5:13	"U r da salt of da earth. But if salt becomes tasteless, by wut will it be made salty? It’s gud 4 nothin’ any longer except 2 be yeeted outside n trampled under foot by ppl.
Mt 5:14	U r da light of da world. A city located on top of a hill can’t be hidden,
Mt 5:15	nor do they light a lamp n place it under a basket, but on a lampstand, n it shines on all those in da house.
Mt 5:16	In da same wae let yo light shine b4 ppl, so dat they can c yo gud works n glorify yo Dad who is in heaven. 

Mt 5:17	"Don’t think dat i’ve come 2 destroy da law or da prophets. i haven't come 2 destroy them but 2 fulfill them.
Mt 5:18	Cuz tbh, until heaven n earth pass away, not 1 tiny letter or 1 stroke of a letter will pass away from da law until all takes place.
Mt 5:19	So whoever abolishes 1 of da least of deez rules n teaches ppl 2 do so gonna be called least in da kingdom of heaven, but whoever keeps them n teaches them, dis person gonna be called great in da kingdom of heaven.
Mt 5:20	Cuz i tell u dat unless yo righteousness greatly surpasses dat of da scribes n Pharisees, u will never enter into da kingdom of heaven. 

Mt 5:21	"U hav heard dat 'twas said 2 da ppl of old, 'Don’t commit murder,' n 'whoever commits murder gonna be subject 2 judgment.'
Mt 5:22	But i tell u dat e’erybody who is angry at his bro gonna be subject 2 judgment, n whoever says 2 his bro, 'Stupid fool!' gonna be subject 2 da council, n whoever says, 'Stubborn fool!' gonna be subject 2 fiery hell.
Mt 5:23	So if u present yo gift at da altar n there remember dat yo bro haz somethin’ against u,
Mt 5:24	leave yo gift there b4 da altar n 1st go be reconciled 2 yo bro, n then come n present yo gift.
Mt 5:25	Settle da case quickly w yo accuser while u r w him on da wae, lest yo accuser hand u over 2 da judge, n da judge 2 da officer, n u be yeeted into prison.
Mt 5:26	TBH, u will never come out of there until u hav paid back da last penny! 

Mt 5:27	"U hav heard dat 'twas said, 'Don’t cheat.'
Mt 5:28	But i tell u dat e’erybody who looks at a woman 2 lust 4 her haz already cheated w her in his heart.
Mt 5:29	And if yo right eye causes u 2 sin, tear it out n yeet it from u! Cuz it’s better 4 u dat 1 of yo members be destroyed than yo whole body be yeeted into hell.
Mt 5:30	And if yo right hand causes u 2 sin, cut it off n yeet it from u! Cuz it’s better 4 u dat 1 of yo limbs be destroyed than yo whole body go into hell. 

Mt 5:31	"And 'twas said, 'Whoever divorces his wife must give her a certificate of divorce.'
Mt 5:32	But i tell u dat e’erybody who divorces his wife, except 4 a matter of sexual immorality, causes her 2 cheat, n whoever marries a divorced woman cheats. 

Mt 5:33	"Again u hav heard dat 'twas said 2 da ppl of old, 'Don’t swear falsely, but fulfill yo oaths 2 da Lord.'
Mt 5:34	But i tell u, don’t swear at all, either by heaven, cuz it’s da throne of God,
Mt 5:35	or by da earth, cuz it’s da footstool of his feet, or by Jerusalem, cuz it’s da city of da great king.
Mt 5:36	And don’t swear by yo head, cuz u aren’t able 2 make 1 hair white or black.
Mt 5:37	But let yo statement be 'Yeah, yeah; no, no,' n anythin’ beyond deez is from da bad 1. 

Mt 5:38	"U hav heard dat 'twas said, 'An eye 4 an eye n a tooth 4 a tooth.'
Mt 5:39	But i tell u, don’t resist da evildoer, but whoever hits u on da right cheek, turn da other 2 him also.
Mt 5:40	And da 1 who wants 2 go 2 court w u n take yo tunic, let him hav yo outer garment also.
Mt 5:41	And whoever forces u 2 go 1 mile, go w him 2.
Mt 5:42	Give 2 da 1 who asks u, n don’t turn away from da 1 who wants 2 borrow from u. 

Mt 5:43	"U hav heard dat 'twas said, 'Luv yo bro' n 'H8 yo enemy.'
Mt 5:44	But i tell u, luv yo enemies n pray 4 those who persecute u,
Mt 5:45	so dat u may be sons of yo Dad who is in heaven, cuz he causes his sun 2 rise on da bad n da gud, n he sends rain on da just n da unjust.
Mt 5:46	Cuz if u luv those who luv u, wut reward do u hav? Don’t da tax collectors also do da same?
Mt 5:47	And if u greet only yo bros, wut r u doin’ dat’s remarkable? Don’t da Gentiles also do da same?
Mt 5:48	So u be perfect as yo heavenly Dad is perfect. 


CHAPTER 6
Mt 6:1	"And take care not 2 practice yo righteousness b4 ppl 2 be seen by them; otherwise u hav no reward from yo Dad who is in heaven.
Mt 6:2	So whenever u practice charitable giving, don’t sound a trumpet in front of u, as da hypocrites do in da synagogues n in da streets, so dat they may be praised by ppl. TBH, they hav received their reward in full!
Mt 6:3	But u, when u practice charitable giving, don’t let yo left hand kno wut yo right hand is doin’,
Mt 6:4	so dat yo charitable giving may be in secret, n yo Dad who sees in secret will reward u. 

Mt 6:5	And whenever u pray, don’t be like da hypocrites, cuz they luv 2 stand n pray in da synagogues n on da corners of da streets, so dat they may be seen by ppl. TBH, they hav received their reward in full!
Mt 6:6	But whenever u pray, enter into yo inner room n shut yo door n pray 2 yo Dad who is in secret, n yo Dad who sees in secret will reward u. 

Mt 6:7	"But when u pray, don’t babble repetitiously like da pagans, 4 they think dat cuz of their many words they gonna be heard.
Mt 6:8	So don’t be like them, 4 yo Dad knows wut u need b4 u ask him.
Mt 6:9	So u pray in dis wae: 
 "Our Dad who is in heaven, may yo name be treated as holy.
Mt 6:10	May yo kingdom come, may wut u want be done on earth as it’s in heaven.
Mt 6:11	Give us 2day our daily bread,
Mt 6:12	n forgive us our debts, as we also hav forgiven our debtors.
Mt 6:13	And don’t bring us into temptation, but deliver us from da bad 1.

Mt 6:14	Cuz if u forgive ppl their sins, yo heavenly Dad will also forgive u.
Mt 6:15	But if u don’t forgive ppl, neither will yo Dad forgive yo sins. 

Mt 6:16	"Whenever u fast, don’t be sullen like da hypocrites, 4 they make their faces unrecognizable so dat they may be seen fasting by ppl. TBH, they hav received their reward in full!
Mt 6:17	But when u r fasting, put olive oil on yo head n wash yo face
Mt 6:18	so dat u won’t be seen by ppl as fasting, but 2 yo Dad who is in secret, n yo Dad who sees in secret will reward u. 

Mt 6:19	"Don’t store up 4 yoselves treasures on earth, where moth n consuming insect destroy n where thieves break in n steal,
Mt 6:20	but store up 4 yoselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor consuming insect destroy n where thieves don’t break in or steal.
Mt 6:21	Cuz where yo treasure is, there yo heart gonna be also. 

Mt 6:22	"Da eye is da lamp of da body. So if yo eye is sincere, yo whole body gonna be full of light.
Mt 6:23	But if yo eye is bad, yo whole body gonna be dark. So if da light in u is darkness, how great is da darkness! 

Mt 6:24	"No 1 is able 2 serve 2 masters. Cuz either he’ll h8 da 1 n luv da other, or he gonna be devoted 2 1 n h8 da other. U aren’t able 2 serve God n money. 

Mt 6:25	"Cuz of dis reason i tell u, don’t be trippin’ 4 yo lyf, wut u will eat, n not 4 yo body, wut u will wear. Is yo lyf not more than food n yo body more than clothing?
Mt 6:26	Consider da birbs of da sky, dat they don’t sow or reap or gather produce into barns, n yo heavenly Dad feeds them. R u not worth more than they’re?
Mt 6:27	And who among u, by bein’ trippin’, is able 2 add 1 hr 2 his lyf span?
Mt 6:28	And y r u trippin’ 'bout clothing? Observe da lilies of da field, how they grow: they don’t toil or spin,
Mt 6:29	but i tell u dat not even Solomon in all his glory wuz dressed like 1 of deez.
Mt 6:30	But if God dresses da grass of da field in dis wae, even tho it’s here 2day n tmr is yeeted into da oven, will he not do so much more 4 u, u of lil’ faith?
Mt 6:31	So don’t be trippin’, sayin’, 'Wut will we eat?' or 'Wut will we drink?' or 'Wut will we wear?,'
Mt 6:32	4 da pagans seek after all deez tingz. Cuz yo heavenly Dad knows dat u need all deez tingz.
Mt 6:33	But seek 1st his kingdom n righteousness, n all deez tingz gonna be added 2 u.
Mt 6:34	So don’t be trippin’ 4 tmr, cuz tmr gonna be trippin’ 4 itself. Each day haz enough trouble of its own. 


CHAPTER 7
Mt 7:1	"Don’t judge, so dat u won’t be judged.
Mt 7:2	Cuz by wut judgment u judge, u gonna be judged, n by wut measure u measure out, it gonna be measured out 2 u.
Mt 7:3	And y do u c da speck dat’s in yo bro's eye, but don’t notice da beam of wood in yo own eye?
Mt 7:4	Or how’ll u tell yo bro, 'Allow me 2 remove da speck from yo eye,' n look, da beam of wood is in yo own eye?
Mt 7:5	Hypocrite! 1st remove da beam of wood from yo own eye n then u will c clearly 2 remove da speck from yo bro's eye! 

Mt 7:6	"Don’t give wut is holy 2 doggos, or yeet yo pearls in front of pigs, lest they trample them w their feet, n turn around n tear u 2 pieces. 

Mt 7:7	"Ask n it gonna be given 2 u; seek n u will find; knock n it gonna be opened 4 u.
Mt 7:8	Cuz e’erybody who asks receives, n da 1 who seeks finds, n 2 da 1 who knocks it gonna be opened.
Mt 7:9	Or wut man is there among u, if his son will ask him 4 bread, will give him a stone?
Mt 7:10	Or also if he’ll ask 4 a fish, will give him a snek?
Mt 7:11	So if u, even tho u r bad, kno how 2 give gud gifts 2 yo kids, how much more will yo Dad who is in heaven give gud tingz 2 those who ask him?
Mt 7:12	So in all tingz, whatever u want dat ppl shud do 2 u, so also u do 2 them. Cuz of dis is da law n da prophets. 

Mt 7:13	"Enter thru da narrow gate, cuz broad is da gate n spacious is da road dat leads 2 destruction, n there r many who enter thru it,
Mt 7:14	cuz narrow is da gate n constricted is da road dat leads 2 lyf, n there r few who find it! 

Mt 7:15	"Beware of false prophets who come 2 u in sheep's clothing, but inside r ravenous wolves.
Mt 7:16	U will recognize them by their fruits: they don’t gather grapes from thorn bushes or figs from thistles, do they?
Mt 7:17	In da same wey, every gud tree produces gud fruit, but a bad tree produces bad fruit.
Mt 7:18	A gud tree isn’t able 2 produce bad fruit, nor a bad tree 2 produce gud fruit.
Mt 7:19	Every tree dat doesn't produce gud fruit is cut down n yeeted into da fire.
Mt 7:20	As a result, u will recognize them by their fruits. 

Mt 7:21	"Not e’erybody who says 2 me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter into da kingdom of heaven, but da 1 who does da will of my Dad who is in heaven.
Mt 7:22	On dat day many will tell me, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in yo name, n expel demons in yo name, n perform many miracles in yo name?'
Mt 7:23	And then i’ll tell them straight, 'i never knew u. Depart from me, u who practice lawlessness!' 

Mt 7:24	"So e’erybody who hears deez words of mine n does them gonna be like a woke man who built his house on da rock.
Mt 7:25	And da rain came down n da rivers came n da winds blew n beat against dat house, n it didn't collapse, cuz its foundation wuz laid on da rock.
Mt 7:26	And e’erybody who hears deez words of mine n doesn't do them gonna be like a dumb man who built his house on da sand.
Mt 7:27	And da rain came down n da rivers came n da winds blew n beat against dat house, n it collapsed, n its fall wuz great." 

Mt 7:28	And it happened when Jesus finished deez words da crowds were amazed at his teaching,
Mt 7:29	cuz he wuz teaching them like 1 who had authority, n not like their scribes. 


CHAPTER 8
Mt 8:1	And when he came down from da mountain, large crowds followed him.
Mt 8:2	And look, a leper approached n worshiped him, sayin’, "Lord, if u r willing, u r able 2 make me clean."
Mt 8:3	And extending his hand he touched him, sayin’, "im willing, be clean." And immediately his leprosy wuz cleansed.
Mt 8:4	And Jesus said 2 him, "C dat u tell nobody, but go, show yoself 2 da priest n offer da gift dat Moe commanded, 4 a testimony 2 them." 

Mt 8:5	Now when he entered Capernaum, a centurion approached him, appealing 2 him
Mt 8:6	n sayin’, "Lord, my slave is lying paralyzed in my house, terribly tormented!"
Mt 8:7	And he said 2 him, "i’ll come n heal him."
Mt 8:8	And da centurion answered n said, "Lord, i ain’t worthy dat u shud come in under my roof. But only say da word n my slave gonna be healed.
Mt 8:9	Cuz i also am a man under authority who haz soldiers under me, n i tell dis 1, 'Go!' n he goes, n 2 anotha 1, 'Come!' n he comes, n 2 my slave, 'Do dis!' n he does it." 

Mt 8:10	Now when Jesus heard dis, he wuz shook, n said 2 those who were following him, "TBH, i’ve found such great faith w nobody in Israel.
Mt 8:11	But i tell u dat many will come from east n west n be seated at da banquet w Abe n Isaac n Jake in da kingdom of heaven.
Mt 8:12	But da sons of da kingdom gonna be yeeted out into da outer darkness. In dat place there gonna be weepin’ n gnashing of teeth!"
Mt 8:13	And Jesus said 2 da centurion, "Go, as u hav believed it gonna be done 4 u." And da slave wuz healed at dat hr. 

Mt 8:14	And when Jesus came into Pete's house, he saw his mom-in-law lying down n suffering w a fever.
Mt 8:15	And he touched her hand n da fever left her, n she got up n began 2 serve him. 

Mt 8:16	Now when 'twas evening, they brought 2 him many who were demon-possessed, n he expelled da spirits w a word. And he healed all those who were sick,
Mt 8:17	so dat wut wuz spoken thru da prophet Isaiah would be fulfilled, who said, 
 "He himself took away our sicknesses, n carried away our diseases."

Mt 8:18	Now when Jesus saw many crowds around him, he gave orders 2 depart 2 da other side.
Mt 8:19	And a scribe approached n said 2 him, "Teacher, i’ll follow u wherever u go!"
Mt 8:20	And Jesus said 2 him, "Foxes hav dens n birbs of da sky hav nests, but da Son of Man haz no place 2 lay his head."
Mt 8:21	And anotha of da homies said 2 him, "Lord, allow me 1st 2 go n bury my dad."
Mt 8:22	But Jesus said 2 him, "Follow me, n leave da ded 2 bury their own ded!" 

Mt 8:23	And as he got into da boat, his homies followed him.
Mt 8:24	And look, a great storm arose on da sea, so dat da boat wuz bein’ inundated by da waves, but he himself wuz asleep.
Mt 8:25	And they came n woke him, sayin’, "Lord, save us! We r dyin’!"
Mt 8:26	And he said 2 them, "Y r u scared, u of lil’ faith?" Then he got up n roasted da winds n da sea n there wuz a great calm.
Mt 8:27	And da men were shook, sayin’, "Wut kinda man is dis, dat even da winds n da sea obey him?" 

Mt 8:28	And when he came 2 da other side, 2 da region of da Gadarenes, 2 demon-possessed men comin’ from among da tombs met him, violent af, so dat nobody wuz able 2 pass by along dat road.
Mt 8:29	And look, they cried out, sayin’, "Wut do u hav 2 do w us, Son of God? Hav u come here 2 torment us b4 da time?"
Mt 8:30	Now a long wae from them a large herd of pigs wuz feeding.
Mt 8:31	So da demons begged him, sayin’, "If u r goin’ 2 expel us, send us into da herd of pigs."
Mt 8:32	And he said 2 them, "Go!" So they departed n went into da pigs, n look, da whole herd rushed headlong down da steep slope into da sea n drowned in da water.
Mt 8:33	Now da herdsmen fled n went into da town n reported everythin’, including da tingz abt da demon-possessed men.
Mt 8:34	And look, da whole town came out 2 meet Jesus, n when they saw him, they begged him dat he’d depart from their region. 


CHAPTER 9
Mt 9:1	And getting into a boat, he crossed over n came 2 his own town.
Mt 9:2	And look, they brought 2 him a paralytic lying on a stretcher, n when Jesus saw their faith, he said 2 da paralytic, "Hav courage, kid, yo sins r forgiven."
Mt 9:3	And look, some of da scribes said 2 themselves, "Dis man is blaspheming!"
Mt 9:4	And knowing their thoughts, Jesus said, "Y do u think bad in yo hearts?
Mt 9:5	Cuz which is easier 2 say, 'Yo sins r forgiven,' or 2 say, 'Get up n walk'?
Mt 9:6	But so dat u may kno dat da Son of Man haz authority on earth 2 forgive sins," then he said 2 da paralytic, "Get up, pick up yo stretcher n go 2 yo home."
Mt 9:7	And he got up n went 2 his home.
Mt 9:8	But when da crowds saw dis, they were afraid n glorified God who had given such authority 2 men. 

Mt 9:9	And as Jesus wuz goin’ away from there, he saw a man called Matty sitting at da tax booth n said 2 him, "Follow me!" And he stood up n followed him. 

Mt 9:10	And it happened as he wuz dining in da house, look, many tax collectors n sinners were comin’ n dining w Jesus n his homeboys.
Mt 9:11	And when they saw it, da Pharisees began 2 tell his homeboys, "Y does yo teacher eat w tax collectors n sinners?"
Mt 9:12	And when he heard it, he said, "Those who r healthy don’t hav need of a doc, but those who r sick.
Mt 9:13	But go n learn wut it means, "i want mercy n not sacrifice." Cuz i didn't come 2 call da gud, but sinners." 

Mt 9:14	Then da homies of Johnny approached him, sayin’, "Y do we n da Pharisees fast often, but yo homies don’t fast?"
Mt 9:15	And Jesus said 2 them, "Da bridegroom's attendants aren’t able 2 mourn as long as da bridegroom is w them. But days r comin’ when da bridegroom is taken away from them, n then they’ll fast.
Mt 9:16	But nobody puts a patch of unshrunken cloth on an old garment, 4 its patch pulls away from da garment, n da tear becomes worse.
Mt 9:17	Nor do they put new wine into old wineskins. Otherwise da wineskins burst n da wine is spilled, n da wineskins r destroyed. But they put new wine into new wineskins n both r preserved." 

Mt 9:18	As he wuz sayin’ deez tingz 2 them, look, 1 of da rulers came n knelt down b4 him, sayin’, "My daughter haz just now died, but come, place yo hand on her n she’ll live!"
Mt 9:19	And Jesus n his homies got up n followed him.
Mt 9:20	And look, a woman who had been suffering w a hemorrhage 12 yrs approached from behind n touched da edge of his cloak,
Mt 9:21	4 she said 2 herself, "If only i touch his cloak i gonna be healed."
Mt 9:22	But Jesus, turning around n seeing her, said, "Hav courage, daughter! Yo faith haz healed u." And da woman wuz healed from dat hr. 

Mt 9:23	And when Jesus came into da ruler's house n saw da flute players n da disorderly crowd,
Mt 9:24	he said, "Go away, cuz da girl isn’t ded, but is sleeping." And they made fun of him.
Mt 9:25	But when da crowd had been sent out, he entered n took her hand, n da girl got up.
Mt 9:26	And dis report went out into dat whole region. 

Mt 9:27	And as Jesus wuz goin’ away from there, 2 blind men followed him, crying out n sayin’, "Hav mercy on us, Son of Dave!"
Mt 9:28	And when he came into da house, da blind men approached him, n Jesus said 2 them, "Do u believe dat im able 2 do dis?" They said 2 him, "Yeah, Lord."
Mt 9:29	Then he touched their eyes, sayin’, "According 2 yo faith let it be done 4 u."
Mt 9:30	And their eyes were opened, n Jesus sternly warned them, sayin’, "C dat nobody finds out."
Mt 9:31	But they went out n spread da report 'bout him in dat whole region. 

Mt 9:32	Now as they were goin’ away, look, they brought 2 him a demon-possessed man who wuz unable 2 talk.
Mt 9:33	And after da demon had been expelled, da 1 who had been mute spoke, n da crowds were shook, sayin’, "Dis haz never been seen b4 in Israel!"
Mt 9:34	But da Pharisees were sayin’, "By da ruler of demons he expels da demons!" 

Mt 9:35	And Jesus wuz goin’ around all da towns n da villages, teaching in their synagogues n proclaiming da gud news of da kingdom n healing every disease n every sickness.
Mt 9:36	And when he saw da crowds, he had compassion 4 them, cuz they were weary n dejected, like sheep dat didn't hav a shepherd.
Mt 9:37	Then he said 2 his homies, "Da harvest is plentiful, but da workers r few.
Mt 9:38	So ask da Lord of da harvest dat he send out workers into his harvest." 


CHAPTER 10
Mt 10:1	And summoning his 12 homies, he gave them authority over dirty spirits, so dat they could expel them n could heal every disease n every sickness.
Mt 10:2	Now deez r da names of da 12 apostles: 1st Simon who is called Pete, n Andrew his bro, James da son of Zebedee, n Johnny his bro,
Mt 10:3	Phil, n Bartholomew, Tommy, n Matty da tax collector, James da son of Alphaeus, n Thaddaeus,
Mt 10:4	Simon da Zealot, n Judas Iscariot--da 1 who also betrayed him. 

Mt 10:5	Jesus sent out deez 12, instructing them sayin’, "Don’t go on da road 2 da Gentiles, n don’t enter into a city of da Samaritans,
Mt 10:6	but go instead 2 da lost sheep of da house of Israel.
Mt 10:7	And as u r goin’, preach, sayin’, 'Da kingdom of heaven haz come near!'
Mt 10:8	Heal those who r sick, raise da ded, cleanse lepers, expel demons. Freely u hav received; freely give.
Mt 10:9	Don’t procure gold or silver or copper 4 yo belts.
Mt 10:10	Don’t take a traveler's bag 4 da road, or 2 tunics, or sandals, or a staff, 4 da worker is deserving of his provisions.
Mt 10:11	And into whatever town or village u enter, inquire who in it’s worthy, n stay there until u depart.
Mt 10:12	And when u enter into da house, greet it.
Mt 10:13	And if da house is worthy, let yo pce come on it, but if it isn’t worthy, let yo pce return 2 u.
Mt 10:14	And whoever doesn't welcome u or listen 2 yo words, shake off da dust from yo feet as u r goin’ out of dat house or dat town.
Mt 10:15	TBH, it gonna be more bearable 4 da region of Sodom n Gomorrah on da day of judgment than 4 dat town! 

Mt 10:16	"Look, im sending u out like sheep in da midst of wolves. So be woke as sneks n innocent as doves.
Mt 10:17	But beware of ppl, cuz they’ll hand u over 2 councils, n they’ll whip u in their synagogues.
Mt 10:18	And u gonna be brought b4 both governors n kings cuz of me, 4 a witness 2 them n 2 da Gentiles.
Mt 10:19	But whenever they hand u over, don’t be trippin’ how 2 talk or wut u shud say, 4 wut u shud say gonna be given 2 u at dat hr.
Mt 10:20	Cuz u aren’t da ones who r talkin’, but da Spirit of yo Dad who is talkin’ thru u. 

Mt 10:21	"And bro will hand over bro 2 death, n a dad his kids, n kids will rise up against parents n hav them put 2 death,
Mt 10:22	n u gonna be hated by e’erybody cuz of my name. But da 1 who endures 2 da end--dis 1 gonna be saved.
Mt 10:23	And whenever they persecute u in dis town, flee 2 anotha, cuz tbh, u will never finish goin’ thru da towns of Israel until da Son of Man comes. 

Mt 10:24	"A homeboy isn’t superior 2 his teacher, nor a slave superior 2 his master.
Mt 10:25	It’s enough 4 da homeboy dat he become like his teacher, n da slave like his master. If they hav called da master of da house Beelzebul, how much more da members of his household? 

Mt 10:26	"So don’t be afraid of them, cuz nothin’ is hidden dat’ll not be revealed, n nothin’ secret dat’ll not become known.
Mt 10:27	Wut i tell u in da dark, tell in da light, n wut u hear in yo ear, proclaim on da housetops.
Mt 10:28	And don’t be afraid of those who kill da body but aren’t able 2 kill da soul, but instead be afraid of da 1 who is able 2 destroy both soul n body in hell.
Mt 10:29	R not 2 sparrows sold 4 a penny? And 1 of them won’t fall 2 da ground without da knowledge n consent of yo Dad.
Mt 10:30	And even da hairs of yo head r all numbered!
Mt 10:31	So don’t be afraid; u r worth more than many sparrows. 

Mt 10:32	"So e’erybody who acknowledges me b4 ppl, i also will acknowledge him b4 my Dad who is in heaven.
Mt 10:33	But whoever denies me b4 ppl, i also will deny him b4 my Dad who is in heaven. 

Mt 10:34	"Don’t think dat i’ve come 2 bring pce on da earth! i haven't come 2 bring pce, but a sword.
Mt 10:35	Cuz i’ve come 2 turn a man against his dad, n a daughter against her mom, n a daughter-in-law against her mom-in-law.
Mt 10:36	And da enemies of a man gonna be da members of his household.
Mt 10:37	Da 1 who luvs dad or mom more than me isn’t worthy of me, n da 1 who luvs son or daughter more than me isn’t worthy of me.
Mt 10:38	And whoever doesn't take up his cross n follow me isn’t worthy of me.
Mt 10:39	Da 1 who finds his lyf will lose it, n da 1 who loses his lyf cuz of me will find it. 

Mt 10:40	"Da 1 who receives u receives me, n da 1 who receives me receives da 1 who sent me.
Mt 10:41	Da 1 who receives a prophet in da name of a prophet will get a prophet's reward, n da 1 who receives a gud person in da name of a gud person will get a gud person's reward.
Mt 10:42	And whoever gives 1 of deez lil’ ones only a cup of cold water 2 drink in da name of a homie, tbh, he’ll never lose his reward." 


CHAPTER 11
Mt 11:1	And it happened dat when Jesus had finished giving orders 2 his 12 homies, he went on from there 2 teach n 2 preach in their towns.
Mt 11:2	Now when Johnny heard in jail da deeds of Christ, he sent word by his homies
Mt 11:3	n said 2 him, "R u da 1 who is 2 come, or shud we look 4 anotha?"
Mt 11:4	And Jesus answered n said 2 them, "Go n tell Johnny wut u hear n c:
Mt 11:5	da blind get sight n da lame walk, lepers r cleansed n da deaf hear, n da ded r raised, n da poor hav gud news announced 2 them.
Mt 11:6	And whoever isn’t offended by me is blessed." 

Mt 11:7	Now as deez were goin’ away, Jesus began 2 talk 2 da crowds abt Johnny: "Wut did u go out into da wilderness 2 c? A reed shaken by da wind?
Mt 11:8	But wut did u go out 2 c? A man dressed in soft clothing? Look, those who wear soft clothing r in da houses of kings.
Mt 11:9	But y did u go out? 2 c a prophet? Yeah, i tell u, n even more than a prophet!
Mt 11:10	It’s dis man 'bout whom it’s written: 
 'Look, im sending my messenger b4 yo face, who will prepare yo wae b4 u.'

Mt 11:11	TBH, among those born of women there hasn't arisen 1 better than Johnny da Baptist. But da 1 who is least in da kingdom of heaven is better than he.
Mt 11:12	But from da days of Johnny da Baptist until now, da kingdom of heaven is treated violently, n da violent claim it.
Mt 11:13	Cuz all da prophets n da law prophesied until Johnny,
Mt 11:14	n if u r willing 2 accept it, he’s Elijah, da 1 who is goin’ 2 come.
Mt 11:15	Da 1 who haz ears, let him hear! 

Mt 11:16	"But 2 wut will i compare dis generation? It’s like kids sitting in da marketplaces who call out 2 1 anotha,
Mt 11:17	sayin’, 
 'We played da flute 4 u n u didn't dance; we sang a be sad n u didn't mourn.'

Mt 11:18	Cuz Johnny came neither eating nor drinking, n they say, 'He haz a demon!'
Mt 11:19	Da Son of Man came eating n drinking, n they say, 'Look, a man who is a glutton n a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors n sinners!' But wisdom is vindicated by her deeds." 

Mt 11:20	Then he began 2 reproach da towns in which da majority of his miracles had been done, cuz they didn't repent:
Mt 11:21	"Damn u, Chorazin! Damn u, Bethsaida! Cuz if da miracles done in u had been done in Tyre n Sidon, they’d hav repented long ago in sackcloth n ashes.
Mt 11:22	Nevertheless i tell u, it gonna be more bearable 4 Tyre n 4 Sidon on da day of judgment than 4 u!
Mt 11:23	And u, Capernaum, will u be exalted 2 heaven? No, u gonna be brought down 2 Hades! Cuz if da miracles done in u had been done in Sodom, it’d hav remained until 2day.
Mt 11:24	Nevertheless i tell u dat it gonna be more bearable 4 da region of Sodom on da day of judgment than 4 u!" 

Mt 11:25	At dat time Jesus answered n said, "i praise u, Dad, Lord of heaven n earth, cuz u hav hidden deez tingz from da woke n smart, n hav revealed them 2 yung kids.
Mt 11:26	Yeah, Dad, 4 2 do so wuz yo gracious will.
Mt 11:27	All tingz hav been handed over 2 me by my Dad, n nobody knows da Son except da Dad, n nobody knows da Dad except da Son n anyone 2 whom da Son wants 2 reveal him.
Mt 11:28	Come 2 me, all of u who labor n r burdened, n i’ll give u rest.
Mt 11:29	Take my yoke on u n learn from me, cuz im gentle n humble in heart, n u will find rest 4 yo souls.
Mt 11:30	Cuz my yoke is ez 2 carry n my burden is light." 


CHAPTER 12
Mt 12:1	At dat time Jesus went thru da grain fields on da Sabbath. And his homeboys were hungry, n they began 2 pluck off heads of grain n eat them.
Mt 12:2	But when da Pharisees saw it, they said 2 him, "Look, yo homeboys r doin’ wut it isn’t ok 2 do on da Sabbath!"
Mt 12:3	So he said 2 them, "Hav u not read wut Dave did when he wuz hungry, n those w him,
Mt 12:4	how he entered into da house of God n ate da bread of da presentation, which 'twas not ok 4 him or 4 those w him 2 eat, but only 4 da priests?
Mt 12:5	Or hav u not read in da law dat on da Sabbath da priests in da temple violate da sanctity of da Sabbath n r guiltless?
Mt 12:6	But i tell u dat somethin’ better than da temple is here!
Mt 12:7	And if u had known wut it means, 'i want mercy n not sacrifice,' u wouldn’t’ve condemned da guiltless.
Mt 12:8	Cuz da Son of Man is lord of da Sabbath." 

Mt 12:9	And goin’ on from there he came into their synagogue.
Mt 12:10	And look, there wuz a man who had a withered hand, n they asked him, sayin’, "Is it permitted 2 heal on da Sabbath?" so dat they could accuse him.
Mt 12:11	But he said 2 them, "Wut man will there be among u who will hav 1 sheep n if dis 1 fell into a pit on da Sabbath, won’t take hold of it n lift it out?
Mt 12:12	Then 2 wut degree is a man worth more than a sheep? So then, it’s permitted 2 do gud on da Sabbath." 

Mt 12:13	Then he said 2 da man, "Stretch out yo hand," n he stretched it out, n 'twas restored as healthy as da other 1.
Mt 12:14	But da Pharisees went out n plotted against him so dat they could destroy him. 

Mt 12:15	Now Jesus, when he learned of it, withdrew from there, n many followed him, n he healed them all.
Mt 12:16	And he warned them dat they shouldn’t reveal his identity,
Mt 12:17	so dat wut wuz spoken thru da prophet Isaiah would be fulfilled, who said, 

Mt 12:18	"Look my servant whom i’ve chosen, my beloved in whom my soul is well pleased. i’ll put my Spirit on him, n he’ll proclaim justice 2 da Gentiles.
Mt 12:19	He won’t quarrel or cri out, nor will anyone hear his voice in da streets.
Mt 12:20	A crushed reed he’ll not break, n a smoldering wick he’ll not extinguish, until he brings justice 2 victory.
Mt 12:21	And in his name da Gentiles will hope.

Mt 12:22	Then a demon-possessed man who wuz blind n mute wuz brought 2 him. And he healed him so dat da man who wuz mute could talk n c.
Mt 12:23	And all da crowds were amazed n began sayin’, "Maybe dis 1 is da Son of Dave!"
Mt 12:24	But da Pharisees, when they heard it, said, "Dis man doesn't expel demons except by Beelzebul da ruler of demons!"
Mt 12:25	But knowing their thoughts, he said 2 them, "Every kingdom divided against itself is laid waste, n every city or household divided against itself won’t stand.
Mt 12:26	And if Satan expels Satan, he’s divided against himself. How then will his kingdom stand?
Mt 12:27	And if i expel demons by Beelzebul, by whom do yo sons expel them? Cuz of dis reason they gonna be yo judges!
Mt 12:28	But if i expel demons by da Spirit of God, then da kingdom of God haz come on u!
Mt 12:29	Or how can someone enter into da house of a strong man n steal his property, unless he 1st ties up da strong man? And then he can thoroughly plunder his house.
Mt 12:30	Da 1 who isn’t w me is against me, n da 1 who doesn't gather w me scatters.
Mt 12:31	Cuz of dis reason i tell u, every sin n blasphemy gonna be forgiven ppl, but da blasphemy against da Spirit won’t be forgiven!
Mt 12:32	And whoever speaks a word against da Son of Man, it gonna be forgiven him. But whoever speaks against da Holy Spirit, it’ll not be forgiven him either in dis age or in da comin’ 1! 

Mt 12:33	"Either make da tree gud n its fruit is gud, or make da tree bad n its fruit is bad, 4 da tree is known by its fruit.
Mt 12:34	Offspring of sneks! How r u able 2 say gud tingz when u r bad? Cuz from da abundance of da heart da mouth speaks.
Mt 12:35	Da gud person from his gud treasury brings out gud tingz, n da bad person from his bad treasury brings out bad tingz.
Mt 12:36	But i tell u dat every worthless word dat they talk, ppl will give an account 4 it on da day of judgment!
Mt 12:37	Cuz by yo words u gonna be vindicated, n by yo words u gonna be condemned." 

Mt 12:38	Then some of da scribes n Pharisees answered him sayin’, "Teacher, we wanna c a sign from u!"
Mt 12:39	But he answered n said 2 them, "An bad n adulterous generation desires a sign, n no sign gonna be given 2 it except da sign of da prophet Jonah!
Mt 12:40	Cuz just like Jonah wuz in da belly of da huge fish 3 days n 3 nights, so da Son of Man gonna be in da heart of da earth 3 days n 3 nights.
Mt 12:41	Da ppl of Nineveh will stand up at da judgment w dis generation n condemn it, cuz they repented at da proclamation of Jonah, n look, somethin’ better than Jonah is here!
Mt 12:42	Da queen of da south will rise up at da judgment w dis generation n condemn it, cuz she came from da ends of da earth 2 hear da wisdom of Solomon, n look, somethin’ better than Solomon is here! 

Mt 12:43	"Now whenever an dirty spirit haz gone out of a person, it travels thru waterless places searching 4 rest, n doesn't find it.
Mt 12:44	Then it says, 'i’ll return 2 my house from which i came out.' And when it arrives it finds da house unoccupied n swept n put in order.
Mt 12:45	Then it goes n brings along w itself 7 other spirits more bad than itself, n they go in n live there. And da last state of dat person becomes worse than da 1st. So it gonna be 4 dis bad generation also!" 

Mt 12:46	And while he wuz still talkin’ 2 da crowds, look, his mom n bros were standing there outside, desiring 2 talk 2 him.
Mt 12:47	And someone told him, "Look, yo mom n yo bros r standing there outside desiring 2 talk 2 u."
Mt 12:48	But he answered n said 2 da 1 who told him, "Who is my mom, n who r my bros?"
Mt 12:49	And stretching out his hand toward his homies, he said, "Look my mom n my bros!
Mt 12:50	Cuz whoever does da will of my Dad who is in heaven, he’s my bro n sister n mom." 


CHAPTER 13
Mt 13:1	On dat day Jesus went out of da house n wuz sitting by da sea.
Mt 13:2	And large crowds gathered close around him, so dat he got into a boat 2 sit down, n all da crowd wuz standing on da shore.
Mt 13:3	And he spoke many tingz 2 them in parables, sayin’, "Look, da sower went out 2 sow,
Mt 13:4	n while he wuz sowing, some seed fell on da side of da path, n da birbs came n devoured it.
Mt 13:5	And other seed fell on da rocky ground, where it didn't hav much soil, n it sprang up at once cuz it didn't hav any depth of soil.
Mt 13:6	But when da sun rose 'twas scorched, n cuz it didn't hav enough root, it withered.
Mt 13:7	And other seed fell among da thorn plants, n da thorn plants came up n choked it.
Mt 13:8	But other seed fell on da gud soil n produced grain, dis 1 a hundred times as much n dis 1 sixty n dis 1 thirty.
Mt 13:9	Da 1 who haz ears, let him hear!" 

Mt 13:10	And da homies came up n said 2 him, "Y do u talk 2 them in parables?"
Mt 13:11	And he answered n said 2 them, "2 u it’s been granted 2 kno da mysteries of da kingdom of heaven, but 2 those ppl it hasn't been granted.
Mt 13:12	Cuz whoever haz, 2 him more gonna be given, n he’ll hav an abundance. But whoever doesn't hav, even wut he’s gonna be taken away from him.
Mt 13:13	Cuz of dis reason i talk 2 them in parables, cuz seeing they don’t c, n hearing they don’t hear, nor do they understand,
Mt 13:14	n w reference 2 them da prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled dat says, 
 "U will listen carefully n will never understand, n u will look closely n will never perceive.
Mt 13:15	Cuz da heart of dis ppl haz become dull, n w their ears they hear w difficulty, n they hav shut their eyes, so dat they’d not c w their eyes n hear w their ears n understand w their heart n turn, n i’d heal them."

Mt 13:16	But yo eyes r blessed cuz they c, n yo ears cuz they hear.
Mt 13:17	Cuz tbh many prophets n gud ppl longed 2 c wut u c, n didn't c it, n 2 hear wut u hear, n didn't hear it! 

Mt 13:18	"U, so, listen 2 da parable of da sower:
Mt 13:19	When anyone hears da word 'bout da kingdom n doesn't understand it, da bad 1 comes n snatches away wut wuz sown in his heart. Dis is wut wuz sown on da side of da path.
Mt 13:20	And wut wuz sown on da rocky ground--dis is da 1 who hears da word n immediately receives it w happiness.
Mt 13:21	But he doesn't hav a root in himself, but lasts only a lil’ while, n when affliction or persecution happens cuz of da word, immediately he falls away.
Mt 13:22	And wut wuz sown into da thorn plants--dis is da 1 who hears da word, n da anxiety of dis world n da deceitfulness of wealth choke da word n it becomes unproductive.
Mt 13:23	But wut wuz sown on da gud soil--dis is da 1 who hears da word n understands it, who indeed bears fruit n produces, dis 1 a hundred times as much, n dis 1 sixty, n dis 1 thirty." 

Mt 13:24	He put b4 them anotha parable, sayin’, "Da kingdom of heaven may be compared 2 a man who sowed gud seed in his field.
Mt 13:25	But while his ppl were sleeping, his enemy came n sowed darnel in da midst of da wheat n went away.
Mt 13:26	So when da wheat sprouted n yielded grain, then da darnel appeared also.
Mt 13:27	So da slaves of da master of da house came n said 2 him, 'Master, did u not sow gud seed in yo field? How then does it hav darnel?'
Mt 13:28	And he said 2 them, 'An enemy haz done dis!' So da slaves said 2 him, 'Then do u want us 2 go n gather them?'
Mt 13:29	But he said, "No, lest when u gather da darnel u uproot da wheat together w it.
Mt 13:30	Let both grow together until da harvest, n at da season of da harvest i’ll tell da reapers, "1st gather da darnel n tie it into bundles 2 burn them, but gather da wheat into my storehouse." '" 

Mt 13:31	He put b4 them anotha parable, sayin’, "Da kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed dat a man took n sowed in his field.
Mt 13:32	It’s da smolest of all da seeds, but when it’s grown it’s larger than da garden herbs n becomes a tree, so dat da birbs of da sky come n nest in its branches." 

Mt 13:33	He told them anotha parable: "Da kingdom of heaven is like yeast dat a woman took n put into 3 measures of wheat flour until da whole batch wuz leavened." 

Mt 13:34	Jesus spoke all deez tingz 2 da crowds in parables, n he wuz sayin’ nothin’ 2 them without a parable,
Mt 13:35	so dat wut wuz spoken thru da prophet would be fulfilled, who said, 
 "i’ll open my mouth in parables; i’ll proclaim wut haz been hidden since da creation."

Mt 13:36	Then he left da crowds n came into da house, n his homies came 2 him sayin’, "Explain da parable of da darnel in da field 2 us."
Mt 13:37	So he answered n said, "Da 1 who sows da gud seed is da Son of Man,
Mt 13:38	n da field is da world. And da gud seed--deez r da sons of da kingdom, but da darnel r da sons of da bad 1.
Mt 13:39	And da enemy who sowed them is da devil, n da harvest is da end of da age, n da reapers r angels.
Mt 13:40	So just like da darnel is gathered n burned w fire, so it gonna be at da end of da age.
Mt 13:41	Da Son of Man will send out his angels n they’ll gather out of his kingdom all da causes of sin n those who do lawless deeds,
Mt 13:42	n yeet them into da fiery furnace. In dat place there gonna be weepin’ n gnashing of teeth!
Mt 13:43	Then da gud will shine like da sun in da kingdom of their Dad. Da 1 who haz ears, let him hear! 

Mt 13:44	"Da kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field, dat a man found n concealed, n in his happiness he goes n sells everythin’ dat he’s n buys dat field. 

Mt 13:45	"Again, da kingdom of heaven is like a merchant searching 4 fine pearls.
Mt 13:46	And when he found 1 valuable af pearl, he went n sold everythin’ dat he possessed n purchased it. 

Mt 13:47	"Again, da kingdom of heaven is like a dragnet dat wuz yeeted into da sea n gathered fish of every kind,
Mt 13:48	which when 'twas filled they pulled 2 shore n sat down n collected da gud fish into containers, but da bad they yote out.
Mt 13:49	So it gonna be at da end of da age. Da angels will go out n separate da bad from among da gud
Mt 13:50	n yeet them into da fiery furnace. In dat place there gonna be weepin’ n gnashing of teeth! 

Mt 13:51	"Hav u understood all deez tingz?" They said 2 him, "Yeah."
Mt 13:52	And he said 2 them, "Cuz of dis reason every scribe who haz been trained 4 da kingdom of heaven is like da master of da house who brings out of his storeroom new tingz n old tingz." 

Mt 13:53	And it happened dat when Jesus had finished deez parables he went away from there.
Mt 13:54	And he came 2 his hometown n began 2 teach them in their synagogue, so dat they were amazed n said, "From where’d dis man get dis wisdom n deez miracles?
Mt 13:55	Is not dis 1 da son of da carpenter? Is not his mom called Mary n his bros James n Joey n Simon n Judas?
Mt 13:56	And aren’t all his sisters w us? From where then did dis man get all deez tingz?"
Mt 13:57	And they were offended by him. But Jesus said 2 them, "A prophet isn’t without honor except in his own hometown n in his own household."
Mt 13:58	And he didn't perform many miracles in dat place cuz of their unbelief. 


CHAPTER 14
Mt 14:1	At dat time Herod da tetrarch heard da report 'bout Jesus
Mt 14:2	n he said 2 his servants, "Dis is Johnny da Baptist! He haz been raised from da ded, n 4 dis reason miraculous powers r at work in him."
Mt 14:3	Cuz Herod, after arresting Johnny, bound him n put him in prison on account of Herodias, da wife of his bro Phil,
Mt 14:4	cuz Johnny had been sayin’ 2 him, "It isn’t ok 4 u 2 hav her."
Mt 14:5	And even tho he wanted 2 kill him, he feared da crowd, cuz they looked on him as a prophet. 

Mt 14:6	But when Herod's birthday celebration took place, da daughter of Herodias danced in da midst of them n pleased Herod.
Mt 14:7	So he promised w an oath 2 give her whatever she asked.
Mt 14:8	And coached by her mom, she said, "Give me da head of Johnny da Baptist here on a platter!"
Mt 14:9	And even tho da king wuz distressed, cuz of his oaths n his dinner guests he commanded da request 2 be granted.
Mt 14:10	And he sent orders n had Johnny beheaded in da prison,
Mt 14:11	n his head wuz brought on a platter n given 2 da girl, n she brought it 2 her mom.
Mt 14:12	And his homeboys came n took away da corpse n buried it, n went n told Jesus. 

Mt 14:13	Now when Jesus heard it, he withdrew from there in a boat 2 an isolated place by himself. And when da crowds heard it, they followed him by land from da towns.
Mt 14:14	And as he got out, he saw da large crowd n had compassion on them n healed their sick.
Mt 14:15	Now when 'twas evening, da homeboys came 2 him sayin’, "Da place is desolate n da hr is late. Release da crowds so dat they can go away into da villages n purchase food 4 themselves."
Mt 14:16	But Jesus said 2 them, "They don’t need 2 go away. U give them somethin’ 2 eat."
Mt 14:17	And they said 2 him, "We don’t hav anythin’ here except 5 loaves n 2 fish."
Mt 14:18	So he said, "Bring them here 2 me."
Mt 14:19	And he commanded da crowds 2 recline 4 a meal on da grass. Taking da 5 loaves n da 2 fish n looking up 2 heaven, he gave thanks. And after breaking them, he gave da loaves 2 da homeboys, n da homies gave them 2 da crowds.
Mt 14:20	And they all ate n were satisfied, n they picked up wut wuz left over of da broken pieces, 12 baskets full.
Mt 14:21	Now those who ate were 'bout 5 K men, in addition 2 women n kids. 

Mt 14:22	And immediately he made da homeboys get into da boat n go ahead of him 2 da other side, while he sent away da crowds.
Mt 14:23	And after he sent away da crowds, he went up on da mountain by himself 2 pray. So when evening came, he wuz there alone.
Mt 14:24	But da boat wuz already many stadia distant from da land, bein’ beaten by da waves, cuz da wind wuz against it.
Mt 14:25	And in da 4th watch of da night he came 2 them, walking on da sea.
Mt 14:26	But da homeboys, when they saw him walking on da sea, were terrified, sayin’, "It’s a ghost!" n they cried out in fear.
Mt 14:27	But immediately Jesus spoke 2 them, sayin’, "Hav courage, im he! Don’t be afraid!"
Mt 14:28	And Pete answered him n said, "Lord, if it’s u, command me 2 come 2 u on da water!"
Mt 14:29	So he said, "Come!" And getting out of da boat, Pete walked on da water n came toward Jesus.
Mt 14:30	But when he saw da strong wind, he wuz afraid. And beginning 2 sink, he cried out, sayin’, "Lord, save me!"
Mt 14:31	And immediately Jesus extended his hand n caught him n said 2 him, "U of lil’ faith! Y did u doubt?"
Mt 14:32	And when they got into da boat, da wind stopped.
Mt 14:33	So those in da boat worshiped him, sayin’, "Fr u r da Son of God!" 

Mt 14:34	And after they had crossed over, they came 2 land at Gennesaret.
Mt 14:35	And when da men of dat place recognized him, they sent word into dat whole surrounding region, n they brought 2 him all those who were sick.
Mt 14:36	And they were begging him dat they might only touch da edge of his cloak, n all those who touched it were cured. 


CHAPTER 15
Mt 15:1	Then Pharisees n scribes came 2 Jesus from Jerusalem, sayin’,
Mt 15:2	"Y do yo homies break da tradition of da elders? Cuz they don’t wash their hands when they eat a meal."
Mt 15:3	So he answered n said 2 them, "Y do u also break da rule of God cuz of yo tradition?
Mt 15:4	Cuz God said, 'Honor yo dad n yo mom,' n 'Da 1 who speaks bad of dad or mom must totally die.'
Mt 15:5	But u say, 'Whoever says 2 his dad or his mom, "Whatever benefit u would’ve received from me is a gift 2 God,"
Mt 15:6	need not honor his dad,' n u make void da word of God 4 da sake of yo tradition.
Mt 15:7	Hypocrites! Isaiah correctly prophesied 'bout u sayin’, 

Mt 15:8	'Dis ppl honors me w their lips, but their heart is far, far away from me,
Mt 15:9	n they worship me in vain, teaching as doctrines da rules of men.'"

Mt 15:10	And summoning da crowd, he said 2 them, "Hear n understand:
Mt 15:11	It isn’t wut goes into da mouth dat defiles a person, but wut comes out of da mouth--dis defiles a person."
Mt 15:12	Then da homeboys came n said 2 him, "Do u kno dat da Pharisees were offended when they heard dis sayin’?"
Mt 15:13	And he answered n said, "Every plant dat my heavenly Dad didn't plant gonna be uprooted.
Mt 15:14	Let them! They r blind guides of da blind. And if da blind guide da blind, both will fall into a pit."
Mt 15:15	But Pete answered n said 2 him, "Explain dis parable 2 us."
Mt 15:16	But he said, "R u also still without understanding?
Mt 15:17	Do u not understand dat everythin’ dat enters into da mouth goes into da stomach n is evacuated into da toilet?
Mt 15:18	But da tingz dat come out of da mouth come from da heart, n deez defile da person.
Mt 15:19	Cuz from da heart come bad plans, murder, cheating, sexual immorality, theft, false witness, abusive speech.
Mt 15:20	Deez r da tingz dat defile a person. But eating w unwashed hands doesn't defile a person!" 

Mt 15:21	And departing from there, Jesus went away 2 da region of Tyre n Sidon.
Mt 15:22	And look, a Canaanite woman from dat district came n cried out, sayin’, "Hav mercy on me, Lord, Son of Dave! My daughter is severely possessed by a demon!"
Mt 15:23	But he didn't answer her a word. And his homies came up n asked him, sayin’, "Send her away, cuz she’s crying out after us!"
Mt 15:24	But he answered n said, "i wasn’t sent except 2 da lost sheep of da house of Israel."
Mt 15:25	But she came n knelt down b4 him, sayin’, "Lord, help me!"
Mt 15:26	And he answered n said, "It isn’t right 2 take da kids's bread n yeet it 2 da doggos!"
Mt 15:27	So she said, "Yeah, Lord, cuz even da doggos eat da crumbs dat fall from their master's table."
Mt 15:28	Then Jesus answered n said 2 her, "O woman, yo faith is great! Let it be done 4 u as u want." And her daughter wuz healed from dat hr. 

Mt 15:29	And departing from there, Jesus went along da Sea of Galilee, n he went up on da mountain n wuz sitting there.
Mt 15:30	And large crowds came 2 him, having w them da mute, blind, lame, crippled, n many others, n they put them down at his feet, n he healed them.
Mt 15:31	So then da crowd wuz shook when they saw da mute talkin’, da crippled healthy, n da lame walking, n da blind seeing, n they praised da God of Israel. 

Mt 15:32	And Jesus summoned his homeboys n said, "i’ve compassion on da crowd, cuz they hav remained w me 3 days already n don’t hav anythin’ 2 eat, n i don’t wanna send them away hungry lest they give out on da wae."
Mt 15:33	And da homeboys said 2 him, "Where in dis desolate place can we get so much bread dat such a great crowd could be satisfied?"
Mt 15:34	And Jesus said 2 them, "How many loaves do u hav?" So they said, "7, n a few lil’ fish."
Mt 15:35	And commanding da crowd 2 recline 4 a meal on da ground,
Mt 15:36	he took da 7 loaves n da fish n after he had given thanks, he broke them n began giving them 2 da homeboys, n da homeboys gave them 2 da crowds.
Mt 15:37	And they all ate n were satisfied, n they picked up wut wuz left over of da broken pieces, 7 baskets full.
Mt 15:38	Now those who ate were 4 K men, in addition 2 women n kids.
Mt 15:39	And after he sent away da crowds, he got into da boat n went 2 da region of Magadan. 


CHAPTER 16
Mt 16:1	And when da Pharisees n Sadducees came 2 test him, they asked him 2 show them a sign from heaven.
Mt 16:2	So he answered n said 2 them, "When evening comes u say, 'It gonna be fair weather cuz da sky is red,'
Mt 16:3	n early in da mornin’, '2day it gonna be stormy weather, cuz da sky is red n darkening.' U kno how 2 evaluate correctly da appearance of da sky, but u aren’t able 2 evaluate da signs of da times.
Mt 16:4	An bad n adulterous generation seeks 4 a sign, n a sign won’t be given 2 it except da sign of Jonah!" And he left them n went away. 

Mt 16:5	And when da homeboys arrived at da other side, they had forgotten 2 take bread.
Mt 16:6	And Jesus said 2 them, "Watch out 4 n beware of da leaven of da Pharisees n Sadducees!"
Mt 16:7	So they were discussing dis among themselves, sayin’, "It’s cuz we didn't take bread."
Mt 16:8	But knowing dis, Jesus said, "Y r u discussing among yoselves dat u didn't take bread, u of lil’ faith?
Mt 16:9	Do u not yet understand or do u not remember da 5 loaves 4 da 5 K, n how many baskets u took up?
Mt 16:10	Or da 7 loaves 4 da 4 K n how many baskets u took up?
Mt 16:11	How do u not understand dat i didn't talk 2 u 'bout bread? But beware of da leaven of da Pharisees n Sadducees!"
Mt 16:12	Then they understood dat he didn't tell beware of da leaven of bread, but of da teaching of da Pharisees n Sadducees. 

Mt 16:13	Now when Jesus came 2 da region of Caesarea Philippi, he began asking his homies, sayin’, "Who do ppl say dat da Son of Man is?"
Mt 16:14	And they said, Some say Johnny da Baptist, but others Elijah, n others Jeremiah or 1 of da prophets."
Mt 16:15	He said 2 them, "But who do u say dat im?"
Mt 16:16	And Simon Pete answered n said, "U r da Christ, da Son of da livin’ God!"
Mt 16:17	And Jesus answered n said 2 him, "Blessed r u, Simon son of Jonah, cuz flesh n blood didn't reveal dis 2 u, but my Dad who is in heaven.
Mt 16:18	And i also tell u dat u r Pete, n on dis rock i’ll build my church, n da gates of Hades won’t overpower it!
Mt 16:19	i’ll give u da keys of da kingdom of heaven, n whatever u bind on earth gonna be bound in heaven, n whatever u release on earth gonna be released in heaven."
Mt 16:20	Then he commanded da homies dat they shud tell nobody dat he wuz da Christ. 

Mt 16:21	From dat time on Jesus began 2 show his homeboys dat he must go 2 Jerusalem n suffer many tingz from da elders n chief priests n scribes, n be killed, n be raised on da 3rd day.
Mt 16:22	And Pete took him aside n began 2 roast him, sayin’, God forbid, Lord! Dis will never happen 2 u!"
Mt 16:23	But he turned around n said 2 Pete, "Get behind me, Satan! U r a cause 4 stumbling 2 me, cuz u aren’t intent on da tingz of God, but da tingz of ppl!" 

Mt 16:24	Then Jesus said 2 his homies, "If anyone wants 2 come after me, let him deny himself n take up his cross n follow me.
Mt 16:25	Cuz whoever wants 2 save his lyf will lose it, but whoever loses his lyf on account of me will find it.
Mt 16:26	Cuz wut will a person be benefited if he gains da whole world but forfeits his lyf? Or wut will a person give in exchange 4 his lyf?
Mt 16:27	Cuz da Son of Man is goin’ 2 come in da glory of his Dad w his angels, n at dat time he’ll reward each 1 accordin’ 2 wut he’s done.
Mt 16:28	TBH, dat there r some of those standing here who will never experience death until they c da Son of Man comin’ in his kingdom." 


CHAPTER 17
Mt 17:1	And after 6 days Jesus took along Pete n James n Johnny his bro, n led them up on a high mountain by themselves.
Mt 17:2	And he wuz transfigured b4 them, n his face shone like da sun, n his clothing became bright as da light.
Mt 17:3	And look, Moe n Elijah appeared 2 them, talking w him.
Mt 17:4	So Pete answered n said 2 Jesus, "Lord, it’s gud dat we're here! If u want, i’ll make here 3 shelters, 1 4 u n 1 4 Moe n 1 4 Elijah."
Mt 17:5	While he wuz still talkin’, look, a bright cloud overshadowed them, n look, a voice from da cloud said, "Dis is my beloved Son, w whom im well pleased. Listen 2 him!"
Mt 17:6	And when da homeboys heard dis, they fell down on their faces n were extremely frightened.
Mt 17:7	And Jesus came n touched them n said, "Get up n don’t be afraid."
Mt 17:8	And when they lifted up their eyes they saw nobody except him--Jesus alone. 

Mt 17:9	And as they were comin’ down from da mountain, Jesus commanded them sayin’, "Tell nobody da vision until da Son of Man is raised from da ded."
Mt 17:10	And da homies asked him, sayin’, "Then y do da scribes say dat Elijah must come 1st?"
Mt 17:11	And he answered n said, "Elijah indeed is comin’, n will restore all tingz.
Mt 17:12	But i tell u dat Elijah haz already come, n they didn't recognize him, but did w him whatever they wanted. In da same wey also da Son of Man is goin’ 2 suffer at their hands."
Mt 17:13	Then da homeboys understood dat he had spoken 2 them 'bout Johnny da Baptist. 

Mt 17:14	And when they came 2 da crowd, a man approached him, kneeling down b4 him
Mt 17:15	n sayin’, "Lord, hav mercy on my son, cuz he’s seizures n suffers severely, 4 often he falls into da fire n often into da water.
Mt 17:16	And i brought him 2 yo homies, n they weren't able 2 heal him."
Mt 17:17	And Jesus answered n said, "O unbelieving n perverse generation! How long will i be w u? How long must i put up w u? Bring him here 2 me!"
Mt 17:18	And Jesus roasted him, n da demon came out of him n da boi wuz healed from dat hr. 

Mt 17:19	Then da homies approached Jesus privately n said, Y were we not able 2 expel it?"
Mt 17:20	And he said 2 them, "Cuz of yo lil’ faith. Cuz tbh, if u hav faith like a mustard seed, u will tell dis mountain, 'Move from here 2 there,' n it’ll move, n nothin’ gonna be impossible 4 u." 

Mt 17:22	Now as they were gathering in Galilee, Jesus said 2 them, "Da Son of Man is goin’ 2 be betrayed into da hands of men,
Mt 17:23	n they’ll kill him, n on da 3rd day he gonna be raised." And they were extremely distressed. 

Mt 17:24	Now when they arrived in Capernaum, da ones who collected da double drachma tax came up 2 Pete n said, "Does yo teacher not pay da double drachma tax?"
Mt 17:25	He said, "Yeah." And when he came into da house, Jesus spoke 2 him 1st, sayin’, "Wut do u think, Simon? From whom do da kings of da earth collect tolls or taxes--from their own sons, or from foreigners?"
Mt 17:26	And when he said, "From foreigners," Jesus said 2 him, "Then da sons r free.
Mt 17:27	But so dat we don’t give offense 2 them, go out 2 da sea, cast a line w a hook, n take da 1st fish dat comes up. And when u open its mouth, u will find a 4-drachma coin. Take dat n give it 2 them 4 me n u." 


CHAPTER 18
Mt 18:1	At dat time da homeboys came up 2 Jesus, sayin’, "Who then is da best in da kingdom of heaven?"
Mt 18:2	And calling a kid 2 himself, he had him stand in their midst
Mt 18:3	n said, "TBH, unless u turn around n become like yung kids, u will never enter into da kingdom of heaven!
Mt 18:4	So whoever humbles himself like dis kid, dis person is da best in da kingdom of heaven,
Mt 18:5	n whoever welcomes 1 kid such as dis in my name welcomes me.
Mt 18:6	But whoever causes 1 of deez lil’ ones who believe in me 2 sin, it’d be better 4 him dat a large millstone be hung on his neck n he be drowned in da depths of da sea.
Mt 18:7	Woe 2 da world cuz of causes 4 stumbling, 4 it’s a necessity dat causes 4 stumbling come; nevertheless, woe 2 da person thru whom da cause 4 stumbling comes.
Mt 18:8	And if yo hand or yo foot causes u 2 sin, cut it off n yeet it from u! It’s better 4 u 2 enter into lyf crippled or lame than, having 2 hands or 2 feet, 2 be yeeted into da eternal fire!
Mt 18:9	And if yo eye causes u 2 sin, tear it out n yeet it from u! It’s better 4 u 2 enter into lyf 1-eyed than, having 2 eyes, 2 be yeeted into fiery hell! 

Mt 18:10	"C 2 it dat u don’t h8 1 of deez lil’ ones, cuz i tell u dat their angels in heaven constantly c da face of my Dad who is in heaven.
Mt 18:12	Wut do u think? If a certain man haz a hundred sheep, n 1 of them wanders away, will he not leave da 99 on da hills n go n look 4 da 1 dat wandered away?
Mt 18:13	And if he happens 2 find it, tbh he rejoices over it more than over da 99 dat didn't wander away.
Mt 18:14	In da same wae it isn’t da will of yo Dad who is in heaven dat 1 of deez lil’ ones die. 

Mt 18:15	"Now if yo bro sins against u, go correct him between u n him alone. If he listens 2 u, u hav gained yo bro.
Mt 18:16	But if he doesn't listen, take w u in addition 1 or 2 others, so dat by da testimony of 2 or 3 witnesses every matter may be established.
Mt 18:17	And if he refuses 2 listen 2 them, tell it 2 da church. But if he refuses 2 listen 2 da church also, let him be 2 u as a Gentile n a tax collector. 

Mt 18:18	"TBH, whatever u bind on earth gonna be bound in heaven, n whatever u release on earth gonna be released in heaven.
Mt 18:19	Again, tbh if 2 of u agree on earth 'bout any matter dat they ask, it gonna be done 4 them from my Dad who is in heaven.
Mt 18:20	Cuz where 2 or 3 r gathered in my name, im there in da midst of them." 

Mt 18:21	Then Pete came up 2 him n said, "Lord, how many times will my bro sin against me n i’ll forgive him? Up 2 7 times?"
Mt 18:22	Jesus said 2 him, "i don’t tell u up 2 7 times, but up 2 seventy times 7! 

Mt 18:23	"Cuz of dis reason da kingdom of heaven may be compared 2 a man--a king--who wanted 2 settle accounts w his slaves.
Mt 18:24	And when he began 2 settle them, someone wuz brought 2 him who owed 10 K talents.
Mt 18:25	And cuz he didn't hav enough 2 repay it, da master ordered him 2 be sold, n his wife n his kids n everythin’ dat he had, n 2 be repaid.
Mt 18:26	Then da slave yote himself 2 da ground n began 2 do obeisance 2 him, sayin’, 'Be patient w me, n i’ll pay back everythin’ 2 u!'
Mt 18:27	So da master of dat slave, cuz he had compassion, released him n forgave him da loan.
Mt 18:28	But dat slave went out n found 1 of his fellow slaves who owed him a hundred denarii, n taking hold of him, he began 2 choke him, sayin’, 'Pay back everythin’ dat u owe!'
Mt 18:29	Then his fellow slave yote himself 2 da ground n began 2 beg him, sayin’, 'Be patient w me n i’ll repay u!'
Mt 18:30	But he didn't wanna, but rather he went n yote him into prison until he’d repay wut wuz owed.
Mt 18:31	So when his fellow slaves saw wut had happened, they were extremely distressed, n went n reported 2 their master everythin’ dat had happened.
Mt 18:32	Then his master summoned him n said 2 him, 'Wicked slave! i forgave u all dat debt cuz u begged me!
Mt 18:33	Shud u not also hav shown mercy 2 yo fellow slave as i also showed mercy 2 u?'
Mt 18:34	And cuz he wuz angry, his master handed him over 2 da merciless jailers until he’d repay everythin’ dat wuz owed.
Mt 18:35	So also my heavenly Dad will do 2 u, unless each of u forgives his bro from yo hearts!" 


CHAPTER 19
Mt 19:1	And it happened dat when Jesus had finished deez statements, he went away from Galilee n came into da region of Judea on da other side of da Jordan.
Mt 19:2	And large crowds followed him, n he healed them there.
Mt 19:3	And Pharisees came up 2 him in order 2 test him, n asked if 'twas permitted 4 a man 2 divorce his wife 4 any cause.
Mt 19:4	And he answered n said, "Hav u not read dat da 1 who created them from da beginning made them male n female
Mt 19:5	n said, 'On account of dis a man will leave his dad n his mom n gonna be joined 2 his wife, n da 2 will become 1 flesh'?
Mt 19:6	So then, they’re no longer 2 but 1 flesh. So wut God haz joined together, man must not separate."
Mt 19:7	They said 2 him, "Y then did Moe command us 2 give a document--a certificate of divorce--n 2 divorce her?"
Mt 19:8	He said 2 them, "Moe, w reference 2 yo hardness of heart, permitted u 2 divorce yo wives, but from da beginning 'twas not like dis.
Mt 19:9	Now i tell u dat whoever divorces his wife, except on da basis of sexual immorality, n marries anotha cheats, n whoever marries her who is divorced cheats." 

Mt 19:10	Da homeboys said 2 him, "If dis is da case of a man w his wife, it’d be better not 2 marry!"
Mt 19:11	But he said 2 them, "Not e’erybody can accept dis sayin’ but those 2 whom it’s been given.
Mt 19:12	Cuz there r eunuchs who were born as such from their mom's womb, n there r eunuchs who were made eunuchs by ppl, n there r eunuchs who hav made themselves eunuchs 4 da sake of da kingdom of heaven. Da 1 who is able 2 accept dis, let him accept it." 

Mt 19:13	Then kids were brought 2 him so dat he could lay his hands on them n pray, but da homeboys roasted them.
Mt 19:14	But Jesus said, "Allow da kids, n don’t forbid them 2 come 2 me, 4 2 such belongs da kingdom of heaven."
Mt 19:15	And he laid his hands on them n traveled on from there. 

Mt 19:16	And look, someone came up 2 him n said, "Teacher, wut gud thang must i do so dat i’ll hav lyf 4ever?"
Mt 19:17	And he said 2 him, "Y r u asking me 'bout wut is gud? There is 1 who is gud. But if u wanna enter into lyf, keep da rules!"
Mt 19:18	He said 2 him, "Which ones?" And Jesus said, "Don’t commit murder, don’t cheat, don’t steal, don’t give false testimony,
Mt 19:19	honor yo dad n yo mom, n luv yo bro as yoself."
Mt 19:20	Da yung man said 2 him, "All deez i’ve observed. Wut do i still lack?"
Mt 19:21	Jesus said 2 him, "If u wanna be perfect, go, sell yo possessions n give da proceeds 2 da poor--n u will hav treasure in heaven--n come, follow me."
Mt 19:22	But when da yung man heard da statement, he went away sad, cuz he wuz 1 who had many possessions. 

Mt 19:23	And Jesus said 2 his homies, "TBH w difficulty a rich person will enter into da kingdom of heaven!
Mt 19:24	And again i tell u, it’s easier 4 a camel 2 go thru da eye of a needle than a rich person into da kingdom of God."
Mt 19:25	So when da homies heard dis, they were extremely amazed, sayin’, "Then who can be saved?"
Mt 19:26	But Jesus looked at them n said 2 them, "Wit human beings dis is impossible, but w God all tingz r possible."
Mt 19:27	Then Pete answered n said 2 him, "Look, we've left everythin’ n followed u. Wut then will there be 4 us?"
Mt 19:28	And Jesus said 2 them, "TBH in da renewal of da world, when da Son of Man sits on his glorious throne, u who hav followed me--u also will sit on 12 thrones judging da 12 tribes of Israel.
Mt 19:29	And e’erybody who haz left houses or bros or sisters or dad or mom or wife or kids or fields on account of my name will get a hundred times as much, n will inherit lyf 4ever.
Mt 19:30	But many who r 1st gonna be last, n da last 1st. 


CHAPTER 20
Mt 20:1	"Cuz da kingdom of heaven is like a man--da master of da house--who went out early in da mornin’ 2 hire workers 4 his vineyard.
Mt 20:2	And after comin’ 2 an agreement w da workers 4 a denarius per day, he sent them into his vineyard.
Mt 20:3	And goin’ out 'bout da 3rd hr, he saw others standing idle in da marketplace.
Mt 20:4	And 2 those ppl he said, 'U also go into da vineyard, n i’ll give u whatever is right.'
Mt 20:5	So they went. Goin’ out again 'bout da 6th n 9th hr he did da same thang.
Mt 20:6	And 'bout da eleventh hr he went out n found others standing there n said 2 them, 'Y r u standing here da whole day unemployed?'
Mt 20:7	They said 2 him, 'Cuz nobody hired us.' He said 2 them, 'U go also into da vineyard.'
Mt 20:8	And when evening came, da owner of da vineyard said 2 his manager, 'Call da workers n pay them their wages, beginning from da last up 2 da 1st.'
Mt 20:9	And when da ones hired 'bout da eleventh hr came, they received a denarius apiece.
Mt 20:10	And when da 1st came, they thought dat they’d get more, n they also received a denarius apiece.
Mt 20:11	And when they received it, they began 2 complain against da master of da house,
Mt 20:12	sayin’, 'Deez last ppl worked 1 hr n u made them equal 2 us who hav endured da burden of da day n da burning heat!'
Mt 20:13	But he answered 1 of them n said, 'Friend, i ain’t doin’ u wrong. Did u not come 2 an agreement w me 4 a denarius?
Mt 20:14	Take wut is urs n go! But i wanna give 2 dis last person da same as i gave 2 u also.
Mt 20:15	Is it not ok 4 me 2 do whatever i want w wut is mine? Or is yo eye bad cuz im generous?'
Mt 20:16	So da last gonna be 1st n da 1st last." 

Mt 20:17	And as Jesus wuz goin’ up 2 Jerusalem, he took da 12 homies by themselves n said 2 them on da wey,
Mt 20:18	"Look, we're goin’ up 2 Jerusalem, n da Son of Man gonna be handed over 2 da chief priests n scribes, n they’ll condemn him 2 death,
Mt 20:19	n will hand him over 2 da Gentiles 2 roast him n whip him n crucify him, n on da 3rd day he gonna be raised." 

Mt 20:20	Then da mom of da sons of Zebedee came up 2 him w her sons, n kneeling down she asked somethin’ from him.
Mt 20:21	And he said 2 her, "Wut do u want?" She said 2 him, "Say dat deez 2 sons of mine may sit 1 at yo right hand n 1 at yo left in yo kingdom."
Mt 20:22	But Jesus answered n said, "U dunno wut u r asking! R u able 2 drink da cup dat im 'bout 2 drink?" They said 2 him, "We r able."
Mt 20:23	He said 2 them, "U will indeed drink my cup, but 2 sit at my right hand n at my left isn’t mine 2 grant, but is 4 those 4 whom it’s been prepared by my Dad." 

Mt 20:24	And when da 10 heard dis, they were indignant abt da 2 bros.
Mt 20:25	But Jesus called them 2 himself n said, "U kno dat da rulers of da Gentiles lord it over them, n those in high positions exercise authority over them.
Mt 20:26	It won’t be like dis among u! But whoever wants 2 become great among u gotta be yo servant,
Mt 20:27	n whoever wants 2 be most prominent among u gotta be yo slave--
Mt 20:28	just like da Son of Man didn't come 2 be served, but 2 serve, n 2 give his lyf as a ransom 4 many." 

Mt 20:29	And as they were goin’ out of Jericho, a large crowd followed him.
Mt 20:30	And look, there were 2 blind men sitting beside da road. When they heard dat Jesus wuz passing by, they called out, sayin’, "Lord, hav mercy on us, Son of Dave!"
Mt 20:31	And da crowd roasted them so dat they’d be quiet. But they called out all da more, sayin’, "Lord, hav mercy on us, Son of Dave!"
Mt 20:32	And Jesus stopped, called them, n said, "Wut do u want me 2 do 4 u?"
Mt 20:33	They said 2 him, "Lord, dat our eyes be opened!"
Mt 20:34	And having compassion, Jesus touched their eyes, n immediately they received their sight n followed him. 


CHAPTER 21
Mt 21:1	And when they drew near 2 Jerusalem n came 2 Bethphage at da Mount of Olives, then Jesus sent 2 homies,
Mt 21:2	sayin’ 2 them, "Go into da village b4 u, n right away u will find a donkey tied n a colt w her. Untie them n bring them 2 me.
Mt 21:3	And if anyone says anythin’ 2 u, u will say, 'Da Lord needs them,' n he’ll send them at once."
Mt 21:4	Now dis took place so dat wut wuz spoken thru da prophet would be fulfilled, sayin’, 

Mt 21:5	"Say 2 da daughter of Zion, 'Look, yo king is comin’ 2 u, humble n mounted on a donkey, n on a colt, da foal of a pack animal.'"

Mt 21:6	So da homeboys went n did just like Jesus directed them,
Mt 21:7	n brought da donkey n da colt n put their cloaks on them, n he sat on them.
Mt 21:8	And a very large crowd spread their cloaks on da road, n others were cutting branches from da trees n spreading them on da road.
Mt 21:9	And da crowds who went ahead of him n da ones who followed were shouting, sayin’, 
 "Hosanna 2 da Son of Dave! Blessed is da 1 who comes in da name of da Lord! Hosanna in da highest heaven!"

Mt 21:10	And when he entered into Jerusalem, da whole city wuz stirred up, sayin’, "Who is dis?"
Mt 21:11	And da crowds were sayin’, "Dis is da prophet Jesus from Nazareth of Galilee!" 

Mt 21:12	And Jesus entered da temple courts n drove out all those who were selling n buying in da temple, n overturned da tables of da money changers n da chairs of those who were selling doves.
Mt 21:13	And he said 2 them, "It’s written, 'My house gonna be called a house of prayer,' but u hav made it a cave of robbers!" 

Mt 21:14	And da blind n da lame came up 2 him in da temple courts n he healed them.
Mt 21:15	But when da chief priests n da scribes saw da wonderful tingz dat he did, n da kids shouting in da temple courts n sayin’, "Hosanna 2 da Son of Dave!" they were indignant.
Mt 21:16	And they said 2 him, "Do u hear wut deez kids r sayin’?" So Jesus said 2 them, "Yeah, hav u never read, 'Out of da mouths of kids n nursing babies u hav prepared 4 yoself praise'?"
Mt 21:17	And leaving them, he went outside of da city 2 Bethany n spent da night there. 

Mt 21:18	Now early in da mornin’, as he wuz returning 2 da city, he wuz hungry.
Mt 21:19	And seeing a single fig tree by da road, he went 2 it n found nothin’ on it except leaves only. And he said 2 it, "May there be no more fruit from u 4ever, n da fig tree withered at once.
Mt 21:20	And when they saw it, da homeboys were shook, sayin’, "How did da fig tree wither at once?"
Mt 21:21	And Jesus answered n said 2 them, "TBH, if u hav faith n don’t doubt, u will don’t only wut wuz done 2 da fig tree, but even if u tell dis mountain, 'Be lifted up n yeeted into da sea," it’ll happen!
Mt 21:22	And whatever u ask in prayer, if u believe, u will get." 

Mt 21:23	And after he arrived at da temple, da chief priests n da elders of da ppl came up 2 him while he wuz teaching, sayin’, "By wut authority r u doin’ deez tingz? And who gave u dis authority?"
Mt 21:24	And Jesus answered n said 2 them, "i also will ask u 1 question. If u tell da answer 2 me, i also will tell u by wut authority im doin’ deez tingz.
Mt 21:25	From where wuz da baptism of Johnny--from heaven or from men?" And they began 2 discuss dis among themselves, sayin’, "If we say 'From heaven,' he’ll tell us, 'Y then did u not believe him?'
Mt 21:26	But if we say, 'From men,' we're afraid of da crowd, cuz they all look on Johnny as a prophet."
Mt 21:27	And they answered n said 2 Jesus, "We dunno." And he said 2 them, "Neither will i tell u by wut authority im doin’ deez tingz. 

Mt 21:28	"Now wut do u think? A man had 2 sons. He approached da 1st n said, 'Son, go work in da vineyard 2day.'
Mt 21:29	And he answered n said, 'i don’t wanna!' But later he changed his mind n went.
Mt 21:30	And he approached da 2nd n said da same thang. So he answered n said, 'i’ll, sir,' n he didn't go.
Mt 21:31	Which of da 2 did da will of his dad?" They said, "Da 1st." Jesus said 2 them, "TBH da tax collectors n da hoes r goin’ ahead of u into da kingdom of God!
Mt 21:32	Cuz Johnny came 2 u in da wey of righteousness n u didn't believe him, but da tax collectors n da hoes did believe him. And when u saw it, u didn't even change yo minds later so as 2 believe in him. 

Mt 21:33	"Listen 2 anotha parable: There wuz a man--a master of a house--who planted a vineyard, n put a fence around it, n dug a winepress in it, n built a watchtower, n leased it 2 tenant farmers, n went on a journey.
Mt 21:34	And when da season of fruit drew near, he sent his slaves 2 da tenant farmers 2 collect his fruit.
Mt 21:35	And da tenant farmers seized his slaves, 1 of whom they beat, n 1 of whom they killed, n 1 of whom they stoned.
Mt 21:36	Again, he sent other slaves, more than da 1st ones, n they did da same thang 2 them.
Mt 21:37	So finally he sent his son 2 them, sayin’, 'They will respeck my son.'
Mt 21:38	But when da tenant farmers saw da son, they said among themselves, 'Dis is da heir. Come, let’s kill him n hav his inheritance!'
Mt 21:39	And they seized him n yote him out of da vineyard n killed him.
Mt 21:40	Now when da master of da vineyard arrives, wut will he do 2 those tenant farmers?"
Mt 21:41	They said 2 him, "He will destroy those bad men totally n lease da vineyard 2 other tenant farmers who will give him da fruits in their season."
Mt 21:42	Jesus said 2 them, "Hav u never read in da scriptures, 
 'Da stone which da builders rejected, dis haz become da cornerstone. Dis came 'bout from da Lord, n it’s marvelous in our eyes'?

Mt 21:43	Cuz of dis reason, i tell u dat da kingdom of God gonna be taken away from u n gonna be given 2 a ppl who produce its fruits.
Mt 21:44	And da 1 who falls on dis stone gonna be broken 2 pieces, n da 1 on whom it falls--it’ll crush him!"
Mt 21:45	And when da chief priests n da Pharisees heard his parables, they knew dat he wuz talkin’ 'bout them,
Mt 21:46	n even tho they wanted 2 arrest him, they were afraid of da crowds, cuz they looked on him as a prophet. 


CHAPTER 22
Mt 22:1	And continuing, Jesus spoke 2 them again in parables, sayin’,
Mt 22:2	"Da kingdom of heaven may be compared 2 a man--a king--who gave a wedding celebration 4 his son.
Mt 22:3	And he sent his slaves 2 summon those who had been invited 2 da wedding celebration, n they didn't wanna come.
Mt 22:4	Again he sent other slaves, sayin’, 'Tell those who hav been invited, "Look, i’ve prepared my dinner; my oxen n fattened cattle hav been slaughtered, n everythin’ is ready. Come 2 da wedding celebration!" '
Mt 22:5	But they paid no attention n went away--dis 1 2 his own field, dat 1 2 his business.
Mt 22:6	And da others, seizing his slaves, mistreated them n killed them.
Mt 22:7	And da king wuz angry n sent his troops n destroyed those murderers n burned their city.
Mt 22:8	Then he said 2 his slaves, 'Da wedding celebration is ready, but those who had been invited weren't worthy.
Mt 22:9	So, go out 2 da places where da roads exit da city n invite 2 da wedding celebration as many ppl as u find.'
Mt 22:10	And those slaves went out into da roads n gathered e’erybody whom they found, both bad n gud, n da wedding celebration wuz filled w dinner guests.
Mt 22:11	But when da king came in 2 c da dinner guests, he saw a man there not dressed in wedding clothes.
Mt 22:12	And he said 2 him, 'Friend, how’d u come in here, not having wedding clothes?' But he could say nothin’.
Mt 22:13	Then da king said 2 da servants, 'Tie him up hand n foot n yeet him into da outer darkness. In dat place there gonna be weepin’ n gnashing of teeth!'
Mt 22:14	Cuz many r called but few r chosen." 

Mt 22:15	Then da Pharisees went n consulted so dat they could entrap him w a statement.
Mt 22:16	And they sent their homies 2 him w da Herodians, sayin’, "Teacher, we kno dat u r truthful n teach da wae of God in truth, n u don’t care wut anyone thinks, cuz u don’t regard da opinion of ppl.
Mt 22:17	So tell us wut u think. Is it permitted 2 pay taxes 2 Caesar or not?"
Mt 22:18	But cuz he knew their maliciousness, Jesus said, "Hypocrites! Y r u testing me?
Mt 22:19	Show me da coin 4 da tax!" So they brought him a denarius.
Mt 22:20	And he said 2 them, "Whose image n inscription is dis?"
Mt 22:21	They said 2 him, "Caesar's." Then he said 2 them, "So give 2 Caesar da tingz of Caesar, n 2 God da tingz of God!"
Mt 22:22	And when they heard dis, they were shook, n they left him n went away. 

Mt 22:23	On dat day Sadducees--who say there’s no resurrection--came up 2 him n asked him,
Mt 22:24	sayin’, "Teacher, Moe said if someone dies without having kids, his bro is 2 marry his wife n dad descendants 4 his bro.
Mt 22:25	Now there were 7 bros w us. And da 1st died after getting married, n cuz he didn't hav descendants, he left his wife 2 his bro.
Mt 22:26	So also da 2nd n da 3rd, up 2 da 7th.
Mt 22:27	And last of all da woman died.
Mt 22:28	In da resurrection, so, whose wife of da 7 will she be? Cuz they all had her as wife."
Mt 22:29	But Jesus answered n said 2 them, "U r wrong, cuz u dunno da scriptures or da power of God!
Mt 22:30	Cuz in da resurrection they neither marry nor r given in marriage, but r like angels of God in heaven.
Mt 22:31	Now abt da resurrection of da ded, hav u not read wut wuz spoken 2 u by God, who said,
Mt 22:32	"im da God of Abe n da God of Isaac n da God of Jake"? He isn’t da God of da ded, but of da livin’!"
Mt 22:33	And when da crowds heard dis, they were amazed at his teaching. 

Mt 22:34	Now when da Pharisees heard dat he had silenced da Sadducees, they assembled at da same place.
Mt 22:35	And 1 of them, a legal expert, put a question 2 him 2 test him:
Mt 22:36	"Teacher, which rule is best in da law?"
Mt 22:37	And he said 2 him, " 'U will luv da Lord yo God w all yo heart n w all yo soul n w all yo mind.'
Mt 22:38	Dis is da best n 1st rule.
Mt 22:39	And da 2nd is like it: 'U will luv yo bro as yoself.'
Mt 22:40	On deez 2 rules depend all da law n da prophets." 

Mt 22:41	Now while da Pharisees were assembled, Jesus asked them,
Mt 22:42	sayin’, "Wut do u think 'bout da Christ? Whose son is he?" They said 2 him, "Dave's."
Mt 22:43	He said 2 them, "How then does Dave, by da Spirit, call him 'Lord,' sayin’, 

Mt 22:44	'Da Lord said 2 my Lord, "Sit at my right hand until i put yo enemies under yo feet" '?

Mt 22:45	If then Dave calls him 'Lord,' how’s he his son?"
Mt 22:46	And nobody wuz able 2 answer him a word, nor did anyone dare from dat day on 2 ask him any more questions. 


CHAPTER 23
Mt 23:1	Then Jesus spoke 2 da crowds n 2 his homeboys,
Mt 23:2	sayin’, "Da scribes n da Pharisees sit on da seat of Moe.
Mt 23:3	So do n observe everythin’ dat they tell u, but don’t do as they do, 4 they tell others 2 do somethin’ n don’t do it themselves.
Mt 23:4	And they tie up heavy burdens n put them on ppl's shoulders, but they themselves aren’t willing w their finger 2 move them.
Mt 23:5	And they do all their deeds in order 2 be seen by ppl, 4 they make their phylacteries broad n make their tassels long.
Mt 23:6	And they luv da place of honor at banquets n da best seats in da synagogues
Mt 23:7	n da greetings in da marketplaces n 2 be called 'Rabbi' by ppl.
Mt 23:8	But u aren’t 2 be called 'Rabbi,' cuz 1 is yo teacher, n u r all bros,
Mt 23:9	And don’t call anyone yo dad on earth, 4 1 is yo heavenly Dad.
Mt 23:10	And don’t be called teachers, cuz 1 is yo teacher, da Christ.
Mt 23:11	And da best among u gonna be yo servant.
Mt 23:12	And whoever exalts himself gonna be humbled, n whoever humbles himself gonna be exalted. 

Mt 23:13	"But damn u, scribes n Pharisees--hypocrites!--cuz u shut da kingdom of heaven b4 ppl! Cuz u don’t enter, nor permit those wanting 2 go in 2 enter. 

Mt 23:15	"Damn u, scribes n Pharisees--hypocrites!--cuz u travel around da sea n da dry land 2 make 1 convert, n when he becomes 1, u make him twice as much a son of hell as u r! 

Mt 23:16	"Damn u, blind guides, who say, 'Whoever swears by da temple, it’s nothin’! But whoever swears by da gold of da temple is bound by his oath.'
Mt 23:17	Fools n blind ppl! Cuz which is better, da gold or da temple dat makes da gold holy?
Mt 23:18	And, 'Whoever swears by da altar, it’s nothin’! But whoever swears by da gift dat’s on it’s bound by his oath.'
Mt 23:19	Blind ppl! Cuz which is better, da gift or da altar dat makes da gift holy?
Mt 23:20	So da 1 who swears by da altar swears by it n by everythin’ dat’s on it.
Mt 23:21	And da 1 who swears by da temple swears by it n by da 1 who dwells in it.
Mt 23:22	And da 1 who swears by heaven swears by da throne of God n by da 1 who sits on it. 

Mt 23:23	"Damn u, scribes n Pharisees--hypocrites!--cuz u pay a 10th of mint n dill n cumin, n neglect da more important matters of da law--justice n mercy n faithfulness! It wuz necessary 2 do deez tingz while not neglecting those.
Mt 23:24	Blind guides who filter out a gnat n swallow a camel! 

Mt 23:25	"Damn u, scribes n Pharisees--hypocrites!--cuz u cleanse da outside of da cup n da dish, but inside they’re full of greed n self-indulgence!
Mt 23:26	Blind Pharisee! 1st clean da inside of da cup n da dish, so dat da outside of it may become clean also. 

Mt 23:27	"Damn u, scribes n Pharisees--hypocrites!--cuz u r like whitewashed tombs which on da outside appear beautiful, but on da inside r full of da bones of da ded n of everythin’ dirty!
Mt 23:28	In da same wey, on da outside u also appear gud 2 ppl, but inside u r full of hypocrisy n lawlessness. 

Mt 23:29	"Damn u, scribes n Pharisees--hypocrites!--cuz u build da tombs of da prophets n decorate da graves of da gud,
Mt 23:30	n u say, 'If we had lived in da days of our dads, we’d not hav been partners w them in da blood of da prophets!'
Mt 23:31	So u testify against yoselves dat u r descendants of those who murdered da prophets!
Mt 23:32	And u--fill up da measure of yo dads!
Mt 23:33	Sneks! Offspring of sneks! How will u escape from da condemnation 2 hell?
Mt 23:34	Cuz of dis reason, look, im sending 2 u prophets n woke men n scribes. Some of them u will kill n crucify, n some of them u will whip in yo synagogues n will pursue from town 2 town,
Mt 23:35	so dat on u will come all da gud blood shed on da earth from da blood of gud Abel up 2 da blood of Zechariah son of Barachiah, whom u murdered between da temple n da altar.
Mt 23:36	TBH, all deez tingz will come on dis generation! 

Mt 23:37	"Jerusalem, Jerusalem, who kills da prophets n stones those who r sent 2 her! How many times i wanted 2 gather yo kids together da wae a hen gathers her yung together under her wings, n u weren't willing!
Mt 23:38	Look, yo house haz been left 2 u desolate!
Mt 23:39	Cuz i tell u, u will never c me from now on until u say, 
 'Blessed is da 1 who comes in da name of da Lord!'" 


CHAPTER 24
Mt 24:1	And as Jesus went out of da temple courts he wuz goin’ along, n his homies came up 2 point out 2 him da buildings of da temple.
Mt 24:2	But he answered n said 2 them, "Do u not c all deez tingz? TBH, not 1 stone gonna be left here on anotha stone dat’ll not be yeeted down!" 

Mt 24:3	And as he wuz sitting on da Mount of Olives, da homeboys came up 2 him privately, sayin’, "Tell us, when will deez tingz happen, n wut gonna be da sign of yo comin’ n of da end of da age?"
Mt 24:4	And Jesus answered n said 2 them, "Watch out dat nobody deceives u!
Mt 24:5	Cuz many will come in my name, sayin’, 'im da Christ,' n they’ll deceive many.
Mt 24:6	And u r goin’ 2 hear 'bout wars n rumors of wars. C 2 it dat u aren’t alarmed, 4 dis must happen, but da end isn’t yet.
Mt 24:7	Cuz nation will rise up against nation n kingdom against kingdom, n there gonna be famines n earthquakes in various places.
Mt 24:8	But all deez tingz r da beginning of birth pains. 

Mt 24:9	"Then they’ll hand u over 2 persecution n will kill u, n u gonna be hated by all da nations cuz of my name.
Mt 24:10	And then many gonna be led into sin n will betray 1 anotha n will h8 1 anotha,
Mt 24:11	n many false prophets will appear n will deceive many,
Mt 24:12	n cuz lawlessness will increase, da luv of many will grow cold.
Mt 24:13	But da 1 who endures 2 da end--dis person gonna be saved.
Mt 24:14	And dis gospel of da kingdom gonna be proclaimed in da whole inhabited earth 4 a testimony 2 all da nations, n then da end will come. 

Mt 24:15	"So when u c da abomination of desolation spoken 'bout by da prophet Danny standing in da holy place" (let da 1 who reads understand),
Mt 24:16	"then those in Judea must flee 2 da mountains!
Mt 24:17	Da 1 who is on his housetop must not come down 2 take tingz out of his house,
Mt 24:18	n da 1 who is in da field must not turn back 2 pick up his cloak.
Mt 24:19	And woe 2 those who r preggers n 2 those who r nursing their babies in those days!
Mt 24:20	But pray dat yo flight may not happen in winter or on a Sabbath.
Mt 24:21	Cuz at dat time there gonna be great tribulation, such as hasn't happened from da beginning of da world until now, nor ever will happen.
Mt 24:22	And unless those days had been shortened, no human bein’ would be saved. But 4 da sake of da elect, those days gonna be shortened. 

Mt 24:23	"At dat time if anyone shud tell u, 'Look, here is da Christ,' or 'Here he’s,' don’t believe him!
Mt 24:24	Cuz false messiahs n false prophets will appear, n will produce great signs n wonders in order 2 deceive, if possible, even da elect.
Mt 24:25	Look, i’ve told u ahead of time!
Mt 24:26	So if they tell u, 'Look, he’s in da wilderness,' don’t go out, or 'Look, he’s in da inner rooms,' don’t believe it!
Mt 24:27	Cuz just like da lightning comes from da east n flashes 2 da west, so da comin’ of da Son of Man gonna be.
Mt 24:28	Wherever da corpse is, there da vultures will gather. 

Mt 24:29	"And immediately after da tribulation of those days, 
 'da sun gonna be darkened n da moon won’t give its light, n da stars will fall from heaven, n da powers of heaven gonna be shaken.'

Mt 24:30	And then da sign of da Son of Man will appear in heaven, n then all da tribes of da earth will mourn, n they’ll c da Son of Man arriving on da clouds of heaven w power n great glory.
Mt 24:31	And he’ll send out his angels w a loud trumpet call, n they’ll gather his elect together from da 4 winds, from 1 end of heaven 2 da other end of it. 

Mt 24:32	"Now learn da parable from da fig tree: Whenever its branch haz already become tender n puts forth its leaves, u kno dat summer is near.
Mt 24:33	So also u, when u c all deez tingz, kno dat he’s near, at da door.
Mt 24:34	TBH dis generation will never pass away until all deez tingz take place!
Mt 24:35	Heaven n earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away. 

Mt 24:36	"But abt dat day n hr nobody knows--not even da angels of heaven nor da Son--except da Dad alone.
Mt 24:37	Cuz just like da days of Noah were, so da comin’ of da Son of Man gonna be.
Mt 24:38	Cuz as in da days b4 da flood they were eating n drinking, marrying n giving in marriage, until da day Noah entered into da ark.
Mt 24:39	And they didn't kno anythin’ until da deluge came n swept them all away. So also da comin’ of da Son of Man gonna be.
Mt 24:40	Then there gonna be 2 men in da field; 1 gonna be taken n 1 left.
Mt 24:41	2 women gonna be grinding at da mill; 1 gonna be taken n 1 left.
Mt 24:42	So be on da alert, cuz u dunno wut day yo Lord is comin’!
Mt 24:43	But understand dis: dat if da master of da house had known wut watch of da night da thief wuz comin’, he’d hav stayed awake n wouldn’t’ve let his house be broken into.
Mt 24:44	Cuz of dis reason u also gotta be ready, cuz da Son of Man is comin’ at an hr dat u don’t think he’ll come. 

Mt 24:45	"Who then is da faithful n woke slave whom da master haz put in charge of his household slaves 2 give them their food at da right time?
Mt 24:46	Blessed is dat slave whom his master will find so doin’ when he comes back.
Mt 24:47	TBH he’ll put him in charge of all his possessions.
Mt 24:48	But if dat bad slave shud tell himself, 'My master is stayin’ away 4 a long time,'
Mt 24:49	n he begins 2 beat his fellow slaves n eats n drinks w drunkards,
Mt 24:50	da master of dat slave will come on a day dat he doesn't expect n at an hr dat he doesn't kno,
Mt 24:51	n will cut him in 2 n assign his place w da hypocrites. In dat place there gonna be weepin’ n gnashing of teeth! 


CHAPTER 25
Mt 25:1	"Then da kingdom of heaven may be compared 2 10 virgins who took their lamps n went out 2 meet da bridegroom.
Mt 25:2	Now 5 of them were dumb n 5 were woke.
Mt 25:3	Cuz when da stupid ones took their lamps, they didn't take olive oil w them.
Mt 25:4	But da woke ones took olive oil in flasks w their lamps.
Mt 25:5	And when da bridegroom wuz delayed, they all became drowsy n fell asleep.
Mt 25:6	But in da middle of da night there wuz a shout, 'Look, da bridegroom! Come out 2 meet him!'
Mt 25:7	Then all those virgins woke up n trimmed their lamps.
Mt 25:8	And da dumb ones said 2 da woke ones, 'Give us some of yo olive oil, cuz our lamps r goin’ out!'
Mt 25:9	But da woke ones answered sayin’, "Totally there’ll never be enough 4 us n 4 u! Go instead 2 those who sell olive oil n buy some 4 yoselves.'
Mt 25:10	But while they had gone away 2 buy it da bridegroom arrived, n those who were ready went inside w him 2 da wedding celebration, n da door wuz shut.
Mt 25:11	And later da other virgins came also, sayin’, 'Lord, lord, open da door 4 us!'
Mt 25:12	But he answered n said, 'TBH, idk u!'
Mt 25:13	So be on da alert, cuz u dunno da day or da hr! 

Mt 25:14	Cuz it’s like a man goin’ on a journey. He summoned his own slaves n handed over his property 2 them.
Mt 25:15	And 2 1 he gave 5 talents, n 2 anotha 2, n 2 anotha 1, 2 each 1 accordin’ 2 his own ability, n he went on a journey immediately.
Mt 25:16	Da 1 who had received da 5 talents went out n traded w them n gained 5 more.
Mt 25:17	In da same wae da 1 who had da 2 gained 2 more.
Mt 25:18	But da 1 who had received da 1 went away n dug up da ground n hid his master's money.
Mt 25:19	Now after a long time, da master of those slaves came n settled accounts w them.
Mt 25:20	And da 1 who had received da 5 talents came up n brought 5 more talents, sayin’, 'Master, u handed over 2 me 5 talents. C, i’ve gained 5 more talents!'
Mt 25:21	His master said 2 him, 'Well done, gud n faithful slave! U were faithful over a few tingz; i’ll put u in charge over many tingz. Enter into da happiness of yo master!'
Mt 25:22	And da 1 who had da 2 talents also came up n said, 'Master, u handed over 2 me 2 talents. C, i’ve gained 2 talents more!'
Mt 25:23	His master said 2 him, 'Well done, gud n faithful slave! U were faithful over a few tingz; i’ll put u in charge over many tingz. Enter into da happiness of yo master!'
Mt 25:24	And da 1 who had received da 1 talent came up also n said, 'Master, cuz i knew u, dat u r a hard man, reaping where u didn't sow n gathering from where u didn't scatter seed.
Mt 25:25	And cuz i wuz afraid, i went away n hid yo talent in da ground. C, u hav wut is urs!'
Mt 25:26	But his master answered n said 2 him, 'Evil n lazy slave! U knew dat i reap where i didn't sow n gather from where i didn't scatter seed.
Mt 25:27	Then u ought 2 hav deposited my money w da bankers, n when i returned i’d hav gotten back wut wuz mine w interest!
Mt 25:28	So take da talent from him n give it 2 da 1 who haz da 10 talents.
Mt 25:29	Cuz 2 e’erybody who haz, more gonna be given, n he’ll hav an abundance. But from da 1 who doesn't hav, even wut he’s gonna be taken away from him.
Mt 25:30	And yeet da worthless slave into da outer darkness--in dat place there gonna be weepin’ n gnashing of teeth!' 

Mt 25:31	Now when da Son of Man comes in his glory n all da angels w him, then he’ll sit on his glorious throne.
Mt 25:32	And all da nations gonna be gathered b4 him, n he’ll separate them from 1 anotha like a shepherd separates da sheep from da goats.
Mt 25:33	And he’ll place da sheep on his right n da goats on da left.
Mt 25:34	Then da king will tell those on his right, 'Come, u who r blessed by my Dad. Inherit da kingdom prepared 4 u from da foundation of da world!
Mt 25:35	Cuz i wuz hungry n u gave me somethin’ 2 eat, i wuz thirsty n u gave me somethin’ 2 drink, i wuz a stranger n u welcomed me as a guest,
Mt 25:36	i wuz nude n u clothed me, i wuz sick n u cared 4 me, i wuz in jail n u came 2 me.'
Mt 25:37	Then da gud will answer him, sayin’, 'Lord, when did we c u hungry n feed u, or thirsty n give u somethin’ 2 drink?
Mt 25:38	And when did we c u a stranger n welcome u as a guest, or nude n clothe u?
Mt 25:39	And when did we c u sick or in prison n come 2 u?'
Mt 25:40	And da king will answer n tell them, 'TBH, in as much as u did it 2 1 of da least of deez bros of mine, u did it 2 me.'
Mt 25:41	Then he’ll also tell those on his left, 'Depart from me, u accursed ones, into da eternal fire dat’s been prepared 4 da devil n his angels!
Mt 25:42	Cuz i wuz hungry n u didn't gimme anythin’ 2 eat, i wuz thirsty n u didn't gimme anythin’ 2 drink,
Mt 25:43	i wuz a stranger n u didn't welcome me as a guest, nude n u didn't clothe me, sick n in prison n u didn't care 4 me.'
Mt 25:44	Then they’ll also answer, sayin’, 'Lord, when did we c u hungry or thirsty or a stranger or nude or sick or in prison n not serve u?'
Mt 25:45	Then he’ll answer them, sayin’, 'TBH, in as much as u didn't do it 2 1 of da least of deez, u didn't do it 2 me.'
Mt 25:46	And deez will depart into eternal punishment, but da gud into lyf 4ever." 


CHAPTER 26
Mt 26:1	And it happened dat when Jesus had finished all deez sayings, he said 2 his homies,
Mt 26:2	"U kno dat after 2 days da Passover takes place, n da Son of Man gonna be handed over in order 2 be crucified." 

Mt 26:3	Then da chief priests n da elders of da ppl assembled in da palace of da high priest, who wuz named Caiaphas,
Mt 26:4	n plotted so dat they could arrest Jesus by stealth n kill him.
Mt 26:5	But they were sayin’, "Not during da feast, so dat there’ll not be an uproar among da ppl." 

Mt 26:6	Now while Jesus wuz at Bethany in da house of Simon da leper,
Mt 26:7	a woman came up 2 him holding an alabaster flask of expensive af perfumed oil, n poured it out on his head while he wuz reclining at table.
Mt 26:8	And when da homies saw it they were indignant, sayin’, "Y dis waste?
Mt 26:9	Cuz of dis could've been sold 4 a large sum n given 2 da poor!"
Mt 26:10	But Jesus, knowing dis, said 2 them, "Y do u cause trouble 4 da woman? Cuz she’s done a gud deed 4 me.
Mt 26:11	Cuz da poor u always hav w u, but u don’t always hav me.
Mt 26:12	Cuz when dis woman poured dis ointment on my body, she did it in order 2 prepare me 4 burial.
Mt 26:13	TBH, wherever dis gospel is proclaimed in da whole world, wut dis woman haz done will also be told in memory of her." 

Mt 26:14	Then 1 of da 12, da 1 named Judas Iscariot, went 2 da chief priests
Mt 26:15	n said, "Wut r u willing 2 gimme if i in turn deliver him 2 u?" So they set out 4 him thirty silver coins.
Mt 26:16	And from dat time on, he began seeking a favorable opportunity so dat he could betray him. 

Mt 26:17	Now on da 1st day of da feast of Unleavened Bread da homeboys came up 2 Jesus, sayin’, "Where do u want us 2 prepare 4 u 2 eat da Passover?"
Mt 26:18	And he said, "Go into da city 2 a certain man n tell him, 'Da Teacher says, "My time is near. im celebrating da Passover w u w my homeboys." '
Mt 26:19	And da homies did as Jesus directed them, n they prepared da Passover.
Mt 26:20	And when 'twas evening, he wuz reclining at table w da 12 homies.
Mt 26:21	And while they were eating he said, "TBH, dat 1 of u will betray me."
Mt 26:22	And greatly distressed, each 1 began 2 tell him, "Ofc i ain’t he, am i, Lord?"
Mt 26:23	And he answered n said, "Da 1 who dips his hand in da bowl w me--dis 1 will betray me.
Mt 26:24	Da Son of Man is goin’ just like it’s written 'bout him, but woe 2 dat man by whom da Son of Man is betrayed! It would be better 4 him if dat man hadn't been born."
Mt 26:25	And Judas, da 1 who wuz betraying him, answered n said, "Ofc i ain’t he, am i, Rabbi?" He said 2 him, "U hav said it." 

Mt 26:26	Now while they were eating Jesus took bread n, after giving thanks, he broke it, n giving it 2 da homeboys, he said, "Take, eat, dis is my body."
Mt 26:27	And after taking da cup n giving thanks he gave it 2 them, sayin’, "Drink from it, all of u,
Mt 26:28	4 dis is my blood of da covenant which is poured out 4 many 4 da forgiveness of sins.
Mt 26:29	But i tell u, from now on i’ll never drink of dis fruit of da vine until dat day when i drink it new w u in da kingdom of my Dad."
Mt 26:30	And after they had sung da hymn, they went out 2 da Mount of Olives. 

Mt 26:31	Then Jesus said 2 them, "U will all fall away cuz of me during dis night, 4 it’s written, 
 'i’ll hit da shepherd n da sheep of da flock gonna be scattered.'

Mt 26:32	But after im raised, i’ll go ahead of u into Galilee."
Mt 26:33	But Pete answered n said 2 him, "If they all fall away cuz of u, i’ll never fall away!"
Mt 26:34	Jesus said 2 him, "TBH during dis night, b4 da rooster crows, u will deny me 3 times!"
Mt 26:35	Pete said 2 him, "Even if it’s necessary 4 me 2 die w u, i’ll never deny u!" And all da homeboys said da same thang. 

Mt 26:36	Then Jesus went w them 2 a place called Gethsemane, n he said 2 da homies, "Sit here while i go over there n pray."
Mt 26:37	And taking along Pete n da 2 sons of Zebedee, he began 2 be distressed n troubled.
Mt 26:38	Then he said 2 them, "My soul is deeply grieved, 2 da point of death. Remain here n stay awake w me."
Mt 26:39	And goin’ forward a lil’ he fell down on his face, praying n sayin’, "My Dad, if it’s possible, let dis cup pass from me. Nevertheless, not as i’ll, but as u will."
Mt 26:40	And he came 2 da homies n found them sleeping, n he said 2 Pete, "So, were u not able 2 stay awake w me 1 hr?
Mt 26:41	Stay awake n pray dat u won’t enter into temptation. Da spirit is willing, but da flesh is weak!"
Mt 26:42	Again 4 da 2nd time he went away n prayed, sayin’, "My Dad, if dis can’t pass unless i drink it, wut u want gotta be done."
Mt 26:43	And he came again n found them sleeping, 4 they couldn't keep their eyes open.
Mt 26:44	And leaving them again, he went away n prayed 4 da 3rd time, sayin’ da same thang again.
Mt 26:45	Then he came 2 da homeboys n said 2 them, "R u still sleeping n resting? Look, da hr is near, n da Son of Man is bein’ betrayed into da hands of sinners.
Mt 26:46	Get up, let’s go! Look, da 1 who is betraying me is approaching!" 

Mt 26:47	And while he wuz still talkin’, look, Judas--1 of da 12--arrived, n w him a large crowd w swords n clubs, from da chief priests n elders of da ppl.
Mt 26:48	Now da 1 who wuz betraying him had given them a sign, sayin’, "Da 1 whom i kiss--he’s da 1. Arrest him!"
Mt 26:49	And he came up 2 Jesus immediately n said, "Greetings, Rabbi," n kissed him.
Mt 26:50	And Jesus said 2 him, "Friend, do dat 4 which u hav come." Then they came up n laid hands on Jesus n arrested him. 

Mt 26:51	And look, 1 of those w Jesus extended his hand n drew his sword, n striking da slave of da high priest, cut off his ear.
Mt 26:52	Then Jesus said 2 him, "Put yo sword back into its place! Cuz all who take up da sword will die by da sword.
Mt 26:53	Or do u think dat i can’t call on my Dad, n he’d put at my disposal at once more than 12 legions of angels?
Mt 26:54	How then would da scriptures be fulfilled dat it must happen in dis wey?" 

Mt 26:55	At dat time Jesus said 2 da crowds, "Hav u come out w swords n clubs, as against a robber, 2 arrest me? Every day in da temple courts i sat teaching, n u didn't arrest me!
Mt 26:56	But all dis haz happened so dat da scriptures of da prophets would be fulfilled." Then da homies all abandoned him n fled. 

Mt 26:57	Now those who had arrested Jesus led him away 2 Caiaphas da high priest, where da scribes n da elders had gathered.
Mt 26:58	But Pete wuz following him from a distance, as far as da courtyard of da high priest. And he went inside n wuz sitting w da officers 2 c da outcome.
Mt 26:59	Now da chief priests n da whole Sanhedrin were looking 4 false testimony against Jesus so dat they could put him 2 death.
Mt 26:60	And they didn't find it, even tho many false witnesses came forward. And finally 2 came forward
Mt 26:61	n said, "Dis man said, 'im able 2 destroy da temple of God n rebuild it within 3 days.'"
Mt 26:62	And da high priest stood up n said 2 him, "Do u reply nothin’? Wut r deez ppl testifying against u?"
Mt 26:63	But Jesus wuz silent. And da high priest said 2 him, "i put u under oath by da livin’ God, dat u tell us if u r da Christ, da Son of God!"
Mt 26:64	Jesus said 2 him, "U hav said it. But i tell u, from now on u will c da Son of Man sitting at da right hand of da Power n comin’ on da clouds of heaven."
Mt 26:65	Then da high priest tore his robes, sayin’, "He haz blasphemed! Wut further need do we've of witnesses? Look, u hav just now heard da blasphemy!
Mt 26:66	Wut do u think?" And they answered n said, "He deserves death!"
Mt 26:67	Then they spat in his face n struck him w their fists, n they slapped him,
Mt 26:68	sayin’, "Prophesy 4 us, u Christ! Who is it who hit u?" 

Mt 26:69	Now Pete wuz sitting outside in da courtyard, n a female slave came up 2 him n said, "U also were w Jesus da Galilean."
Mt 26:70	But he denied it in da presence of them all, sayin’, "idk wut u mean!"
Mt 26:71	And when he went out 2 da gateway, anotha female slave saw him n said 2 those who were there, "Dis man wuz w Jesus da Nazarene."
Mt 26:72	And again he denied it w an oath, "idk da man!"
Mt 26:73	And after a lil’ while those who were standing there came up n said 2 Pete, "U rly r 1 of them also, cuz even yo accent reveals who u r."
Mt 26:74	Then he began 2 curse n 2 swear w an oath, "idk da man!" And immediately a rooster crowed.
Mt 26:75	And Pete remembered da statement Jesus had said, "B4 da rooster crows, u will deny me 3 times," n he went outside n cried bitterly. 


CHAPTER 27
Mt 27:1	Now when 'twas early mornin’, all da chief priests n da elders of da ppl took counsel against Jesus in order 2 put him 2 death.
Mt 27:2	And after tying him up, they led him away n handed him over 2 Pilate da governor. 

Mt 27:3	Then when Judas, da 1 who had betrayed him, saw dat he had been condemned, he regretted wut he had done n returned da thirty silver coins 2 da chief priests n elders,
Mt 27:4	sayin’, "i’ve sinned by betraying innocent blood!" But they said, "Wut is dat 2 us? U c 2 it!"
Mt 27:5	And throwing da silver coins into da temple he departed. And he went away n hanged himself.
Mt 27:6	But da chief priests took da silver coins n said, "It isn’t ok 2 put them into da temple treasury, cuz it’s blood money."
Mt 27:7	And after taking counsel, they purchased w them da Potter's Field, 4 a burial place 4 strangers.
Mt 27:8	(Cuz of dis reason dat field haz been called da Field of Blood until 2day.)
Mt 27:9	Then wut wuz spoken by da prophet Jeremiah wuz fulfilled, who said, "And they took da thirty silver coins, da price of da 1 who had been priced, on whom a price had been set by da sons of Israel,
Mt 27:10	n they gave them 4 da potter's field, just like da Lord directed me." 

Mt 27:11	So Jesus stood b4 da governor, n da governor asked him, sayin’, "R u da king of da Jews?" And Jesus said, "U say so."
Mt 27:12	And when he wuz bein’ accused by da chief priests n elders he answered nothin’.
Mt 27:13	Then Pilate said 2 him, "Do u not hear how many tingz they’re testifying against u?"
Mt 27:14	And he didn't reply 2 him, not even w reference 2 1 statement, so dat da governor wuz very shook. 

Mt 27:15	Now at each feast, da governor wuz accustomed 2 release 1 prisoner 2 da crowd--da 1 whom they wanted.
Mt 27:16	And at dat time they had a notorious prisoner named Jesus Barabbas.
Mt 27:17	So after they had assembled, Pilate said 2 them, "Whom do u want me 2 release 4 u--Jesus Barabbas or Jesus who is called Christ?"
Mt 27:18	(Cuz he knew dat they had handed him over cuz of envy.
Mt 27:19	And while he wuz sitting on da judgment seat, his wife sent a msg 2 him, sayin’, "Hav nothin’ 2 do w dat gud man, cuz i’ve suffered much as a result of a dream 2day cuz of him.")
Mt 27:20	But da chief priests n da elders persuaded da crowds dat they shud ask 4 Barabbas n put Jesus 2 death.
Mt 27:21	So da governor answered n said 2 them, "Which of da 2 do u want me 2 release 4 u?" And they said, "Barabbas!"
Mt 27:22	Pilate said 2 them, "Wut then shud i do w Jesus, da 1 who is called Christ?" They all said, "Let him be crucified!"
Mt 27:23	And he said, "Y? Wut wrong haz he done?" But they began 2 shout even louder, sayin’, "Let him be crucified!" 

Mt 27:24	So Pilate, when he saw dat he wuz accomplishing nothin’, but instead an uproar wuz developing, took water n washed his hands b4 da crowd, sayin’, "im innocent of da blood of dis man. U c 2 it!"
Mt 27:25	And all da ppl answered n said, "His blood be on us n on our kids!"
Mt 27:26	Then he released Barabbas 4 them, but after he had Jesus whipped, he handed him over so dat he could be crucified. 

Mt 27:27	Then da soldiers of da governor took Jesus into da governor's rez n gathered da whole cohort 2 him.
Mt 27:28	And they stripped him n put a scarlet military cloak around him,
Mt 27:29	n weaving a crown of thorns, they put it on his head, n put a reed in his right hand. And kneeling down b4 him, they roasted him, sayin’, "Hail, king of da Jews!"
Mt 27:30	And they spat on him n took da reed n repeatedly struck him on his head.
Mt 27:31	And when they had roasted him, they stripped him of da military cloak n put his own clothes on him, n led him away in order 2 crucify him. 

Mt 27:32	And as they were goin’ out, they found a man of Cyrene named Simon. They forced dis man 2 carry his cross.
Mt 27:33	And when they came 2 a place called Golgotha (which means Place of a Skull),
Mt 27:34	they gave him wine mixed w gall 2 drink, n when he tasted it he didn't wanna drink it.
Mt 27:35	And when they had crucified him, they divided his clothes among themselves by casting lots.
Mt 27:36	And they sat down n were watching over him there.
Mt 27:37	And they put above his head da charge against him in writing: "Dis is Jesus, da king of da Jews."
Mt 27:38	Then 2 robbers were crucified w him, 1 on his right n 1 on his left.
Mt 27:39	And those who passed by reviled him, shaking their heads
Mt 27:40	n sayin’, "Da 1 who’d destroy da temple n rebuild it in 3 days, save yoself! If u r da Son of God, come down from da cross!"
Mt 27:41	In da same wae also da chief priests, along w da scribes n elders, were roasting him, sayin’,
Mt 27:42	"He saved others; he’s not able 2 save himself! He is da king of Israel! Let him come down now from da cross, n we'll believe in him!
Mt 27:43	He trusts in God; let him deliver him now if he wants 2, cuz he said, 'im da Son of God'!"
Mt 27:44	And in da same wae even da robbers who were crucified w him were reviling him. 

Mt 27:45	Now from da 6th hr, darkness came over all da land until da 9th hr.
Mt 27:46	And 'bout da 9th hr Jesus cried out w a loud voice, sayin’, "Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?" (dat’s, "My God, my God, y hav u forsaken me?")
Mt 27:47	And some of those who were standing there, when they heard it, said, "Dis man is summoning Elijah!"
Mt 27:48	And immediately 1 of them ran n took a sponge n filled it w sour wine n put it on a reed n gave it 2 him 2 drink.
Mt 27:49	But da others said, "Leave him alone! let’s c if Elijah is comin’ 2 save him."
Mt 27:50	And Jesus cried out again w a loud voice n gave up his spirit.
Mt 27:51	And look, da curtain of da temple wuz torn in 2 from top 2 bottom, n da earth shook n da rocks were split.
Mt 27:52	And da tombs were opened, n many bodies of da saints who had fallen asleep were raised,
Mt 27:53	n comin’ out of da tombs after his resurrection, they went into da holy city n appeared 2 many. 

Mt 27:54	Now da centurion n those w him who were guarding Jesus, when they saw da earthquake n da tingz dat took place, were extremely frightened, sayin’, "Fr dis man wuz God's Son!"
Mt 27:55	And there were many women there, observing from a distance, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, serving him,
Mt 27:56	among whom were Mary Magdalene, n Mary da mom of James n Joey, n da mom of da sons of Zebedee. 

Mt 27:57	Now when 'twas evening, a rich man from Arimathea named Joey came, who also wuz a homie of Jesus himself.
Mt 27:58	Dis man approached Pilate n asked 4 da body of Jesus. Then Pilate ordered it 2 be given 2 him.
Mt 27:59	And Joey took da body n wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,
Mt 27:60	n placed it in his own new tomb dat he had cut in da rock. And he rolled a large stone 2 da entrance of da tomb n went away.
Mt 27:61	Now Mary Magdalene n da other Mary were there, sitting opposite da tomb. 

Mt 27:62	Now on da next day, which is after da day of preparation, da chief priests n da Pharisees assembled b4 Pilate,
Mt 27:63	sayin’, "Sir, we remember dat while dat deceiver wuz still alive he said, 'After 3 days i’ll rise.'
Mt 27:64	So give orders dat da tomb be made secure until da 3rd day, lest his homeboys come n steal him n tell da ppl, 'He haz been raised from da ded,' n da last deception gonna be worse than da 1st."
Mt 27:65	Pilate said 2 them, "U hav a guard of soldiers. Go, make it as secure as u kno how."
Mt 27:66	So they went w da guard of soldiers n made da tomb secure by sealing da stone. 


CHAPTER 28
Mt 28:1	Now after da Sabbath, at da dawning on da 1st day of da week, Mary Magdalene n da other Mary came 2 view da tomb.
Mt 28:2	And look, there wuz a great earthquake, 4 an angel of da Lord went down from heaven n came up n rolled away da stone n sat down on it.
Mt 28:3	Now his appearance wuz like lightning n his clothing white as snow.
Mt 28:4	And da guards trembled from da fear of him n became like ded men.
Mt 28:5	But da angel answered n said 2 da women, "Don’t be afraid, cuz i kno dat u r looking 4 Jesus, who wuz crucified.
Mt 28:6	He isn’t here, 4 he’s been raised, just like he said. Come, c da place where he wuz lying.
Mt 28:7	And go quickly, tell his homeboys, 'He haz been raised from da ded, n look, he’s goin’ ahead of u into Galilee. U will c him there.' Look, i’ve told u."
Mt 28:8	And they departed quickly from da tomb w fear n great happiness, n ran 2 tell his homies.
Mt 28:9	And look, Jesus met them, sayin’, "Greetings!" And they came up n took hold of his feet n worshiped him.
Mt 28:10	Then Jesus said 2 them, "Don’t be afraid! Go tell my bros dat they shud go 2 Galilee, n there they’ll c me." 

Mt 28:11	And while they were goin’, look, some of da guard of soldiers went into da city n reported 2 da chief priests everythin’ dat had happened.
Mt 28:12	And after they had assembled w da elders n had taken counsel, they gave a rather large sum of money 2 da soldiers,
Mt 28:13	telling them, "Say 'His homies came during da night n stole him while we were sleeping.'
Mt 28:14	And if dis matter is heard b4 da governor, we'll satisfy him n keep u out of trouble."
Mt 28:15	So they took da money n did as they were told, n spread abroad dis report among da Jews until dis very day. 

Mt 28:16	So da 11 homeboys proceeded 2 Galilee, 2 da mountain which Jesus had designated 4 them.
Mt 28:17	And when they saw him, they worshiped him, but some doubted.
Mt 28:18	And Jesus approached n spoke 2 them, sayin’, "All authority in heaven n on earth haz been given 2 me.
Mt 28:19	So, go n make homies of all da nations, baptizin’ them in da name of da Dad n of da Son n of da Holy Spirit,
Mt 28:20	teaching them 2 observe everythin’ i’ve commanded u, n look, im w u all da days until da end of da age."
