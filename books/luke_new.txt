CHAPTER 1
Lk 1:1	Since many hav attempted 2 compile an account abt da events dat hav been fulfilled among us,
Lk 1:2	just like those who were eyewitnesses n servants of da word from da beginning passed on 2 us,
Lk 1:3	it seemed best 2 me also--cuz i’ve followed all tingz carefully from da beginning--2 write them down in orderly sequence 4 u, most excellent Theophilus,
Lk 1:4	so dat u may kno da certainty abt da tingz 'bout which u were taught. 

Lk 1:5	It happened dat in da days of Herod, king of Judea, there wuz a certain priest, Zechariah by name, of da division of Abijah. And he had a wife from da daughters of Aaron, n her name wuz Elizabeth.
Lk 1:6	And they were both gud in da sight of God, livin’ blamelessly in all da rules n regulations of da Lord.
Lk 1:7	And they didn't hav a kid, cuz Elizabeth wuz barren. And they were both advanced in yrs. 

Lk 1:8	And it happened dat while he wuz serving as priest b4 God in da order of his division,
Lk 1:9	accordin’ 2 da custom of da priesthood he wuz chosen by lot 2 enter into da temple of da Lord 2 burn incense.
Lk 1:10	And da whole crowd of da ppl were praying outside at da hr of da incense offering.
Lk 1:11	And an angel of da Lord appeared 2 him, standing at da right side of da altar of incense.
Lk 1:12	And Zechariah wuz terrified when he saw da angel, n fear fell on him.
Lk 1:13	But da angel said 2 him, 
 "Don’t be afraid, Zechariah, cuz yo prayer haz been heard, n yo wife Elizabeth will bear u a son, n u will call his name Johnny.
Lk 1:14	And u will experience happiness n exultation, n many will rejoice at his birth.
Lk 1:15	Cuz he gonna be great in da sight of da Lord, n he must never drink wine or beer, n he gonna be filled w da Holy Spirit while he’s still in his mom's womb.
Lk 1:16	And he’ll turn many of da sons of Israel 2 da Lord their God.
Lk 1:17	And he’ll go on b4 him in da spirit n power of Elijah, 2 turn da hearts of da dads 2 da kids, n da disobedient 2 da wisdom of da gud, 2 prepare 4 da Lord a ppl made ready."

Lk 1:18	And Zechariah said 2 da angel, "By wut will i kno dis? Cuz im an old man, n my wife is advanced in yrs!"
Lk 1:19	And da angel answered n said 2 him, "im Gabe, who stands in da presence of God, n i wuz sent 2 talk 2 u n 2 announce 2 u dis gud news.
Lk 1:20	And look, u gonna be silent n not able 2 talk until da day deez tingz take place, cuz u didn't believe my words, which gonna be fulfilled in their time." 

Lk 1:21	And da ppl were waiting 4 Zechariah, n began 2 wonder when he wuz delayed in da temple.
Lk 1:22	And when he came out he wasn’t able 2 talk 2 them, n they realized dat he had seen a vision in da temple. And he kept making signs 2 them, n remained unable 2 talk.
Lk 1:23	And it happened dat when da days of his service came 2 an end, he went away 2 his home. 

Lk 1:24	Now after deez days, his wife Elizabeth conceived, n she kept herself in seclusion 4 5 months, sayin’,
Lk 1:25	"So da Lord haz done 4 me in da days in which he’s concerned himself w me, 2 take away my disgrace among ppl." 

Lk 1:26	Now in da 6th month, da angel Gabe wuz sent from God 2 a town of Galilee named Nazareth,
Lk 1:27	2 a virgin legally promised in marriage 2 a man named Joey of da house of Dave. And da name of da virgin wuz Mary.
Lk 1:28	And he came 2 her n said, "Greetings, favored 1! Da Lord is w u."
Lk 1:29	But she wuz greatly perplexed at da statement, n wuz pondering wut kinda greeting dis might be.
Lk 1:30	And da angel said 2 her, 
 "Don’t be afraid, Mary, 4 u hav found favor w God.
Lk 1:31	And look, u will conceive in da womb n will give birth 2 a son, n u will call his name Jesus.
Lk 1:32	Dis 1 gonna be great, n he gonna be called da Son of da Most High, n da Lord God will give him da throne of his dad Dave.
Lk 1:33	And he’ll reign over da house of Jake 4ever, n of his kingdom there gonna be no end.

Lk 1:34	And Mary said 2 da angel, "How will dis be, since i haven't had sexy times w a man?"
Lk 1:35	And da angel answered n said 2 her, 
 "Da Holy Spirit will come on u, n da power of da Most High will overshadow u. So also da 1 2 be born gonna be called holy, da Son of God.

Lk 1:36	And look, yo relative Elizabeth--she also haz conceived a son in her old age, n dis is da 6th month 4 her who wuz called barren.
Lk 1:37	Cuz nothin’ gonna be impossible w God." 

Lk 1:38	So Mary said, "Look, da Lord's female slave! May it happen 2 me accordin’ 2 yo word." And da angel departed from her. 

Lk 1:39	Now in those days Mary set out n traveled w haste into da hill country, 2 a town of Judah,
Lk 1:40	n entered into da house of Zechariah, n greeted Elizabeth.
Lk 1:41	And it happened dat when Elizabeth heard da greeting of Mary, da baby in her womb leaped n Elizabeth wuz filled w da Holy Spirit.
Lk 1:42	And she cried out w a loud shout n said, 
 "Blessed r u among women, n blessed is da fruit of yo womb!

Lk 1:43	And y is dis granted 2 me, dat da mom of my Lord shud come 2 me?
Lk 1:44	Cuz look, when da sound of yo greeting came 2 my ears, da baby in my womb leaped 4 happiness!
Lk 1:45	And blessed is she who believed dat there gonna be a fulfillment 2 wut wuz spoken 2 her from da Lord!" 

Lk 1:46	And Mary said, 
 "My soul exalts da Lord,
Lk 1:47	n my spirit haz rejoiced greatly in God my Savior,
Lk 1:48	cuz he’s looked on da humble state of his female slave, 4 look, from now on all gens will consider me blessed,
Lk 1:49	cuz da Mighty 1 haz done great tingz 4 me, n holy is his name.
Lk 1:50	And his mercy is 4 generation after generation 2 those who fear him.
Lk 1:51	He haz done a mighty deed w his arm; he’s dispersed da proud in da thoughts of their hearts.
Lk 1:52	He haz brought down rulers from their thrones, n haz exalted da lowly.
Lk 1:53	He haz filled those who r hungry w gud tingz, n those who r rich he’s sent away empty-handed.
Lk 1:54	He haz helped Israel his servant, remembering his mercy,
Lk 1:55	just like he spoke 2 our dads, 2 Abe n 2 his descendants 4ever."

Lk 1:56	And Mary stayed w her 'bout 3 months, n returned 2 her home. 

Lk 1:57	Now da time came 4 Elizabeth dat she shud give birth, n she gave birth 2 a son.
Lk 1:58	And her bros n relatives heard dat da Lord had shown his great mercy 2 her, n they rejoiced w her.
Lk 1:59	And it happened dat on da 8th day they came 2 cut da kid, n they were wanting 2 name him after his dad Zechariah.
Lk 1:60	And his mom answered n said, "No, but he gonna be named Johnny."
Lk 1:61	And they said 2 her, "There is nobody of yo relatives who is called by dis name."
Lk 1:62	So they made signs 2 his dad asking wut he wanted him 2 be named,
Lk 1:63	n he asked 4 a writing tablet n wrote, sayin’, "Johnny is his name." And they were all shook.
Lk 1:64	And his mouth n his tongue were opened immediately, n he began 2 talk, praising God.
Lk 1:65	And fear came on all those who lived near them, n in all da hill country of Judea all deez events were discussed.
Lk 1:66	And all those who heard kept deez tingz in their hearts, sayin’, "Wut then will dis kid be? Cuz indeed da hand of da Lord wuz w him!" 

Lk 1:67	And his dad Zechariah wuz filled w da Holy Spirit n prophesied, sayin’, 

Lk 1:68	"Blessed be da Lord, da God of Israel, cuz he’s visited 2 help n haz redeemed his ppl,
Lk 1:69	n haz raised up a horn of salvation 4 us in da house of his servant Dave,
Lk 1:70	just like he spoke thru da mouth of his holy prophets from earliest times--
Lk 1:71	salvation from our enemies n from da hand of all those who h8 us,
Lk 1:72	2 show mercy 2 our dads n 2 remember his holy covenant,
Lk 1:73	da oath dat he swore 2 Abe our dad, 2 grant us
Lk 1:74	dat we, bein’ rescued from da hand of our enemies, could serve him without fear
Lk 1:75	in holiness n righteousness b4 him all our days.
Lk 1:76	And so u, kid, gonna be called da prophet of da Most High, 4 u will go on b4 da Lord 2 prepare his ways,
Lk 1:77	2 give knowledge of salvation 2 his ppl by da forgiveness of their sins,
Lk 1:78	cuz of da merciful compassion of our God by which da dawn will visit 2 help us from on high,
Lk 1:79	2 give light 2 those who sit in darkness n in da shadow of death, 2 direct our feet into da wae of pce."

Lk 1:80	And da kid kept growing n becoming strong in spirit, n wuz in da wilderness until da day of his public appearance 2 Israel. 


CHAPTER 2
Lk 2:1	Now it happened dat in those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus 2 register all da empire.
Lk 2:2	(Dis 1st registration took place when Quirinius wuz governor of Syria.)
Lk 2:3	And e’erybody went 2 be registered, each 1 2 his own town.
Lk 2:4	So Joey also went up from Galilee, from da town of Nazareth, 2 Judea, 2 da city of Dave which is called Bethlehem, cuz he wuz of da house n fam line of Dave,
Lk 2:5	2 be registered together w Mary, who wuz legally promised in marriage 2 him n wuz preggers.
Lk 2:6	And it happened dat while they were there, da time came 4 her 2 give birth.
Lk 2:7	And she gave birth 2 her firstborn son, n wrapped him in strips of cloth n laid him in a manger, cuz there wuz no place 4 them in da inn. 

Lk 2:8	And there were shepherds in da same region, livin’ out of doors n keeping watch, guarding over their flock by night.
Lk 2:9	And an angel of da Lord stood near them, n da glory of da Lord shone around them, n they were terribly frightened.
Lk 2:10	And da angel said 2 them, "Don’t be afraid, 4 look, i bring gud news 2 u of great happiness which gonna be 4 all da ppl:
Lk 2:11	dat 2day a Savior, who is Christ da Lord, wuz born 4 u in da city of Dave.
Lk 2:12	And dis gonna be da sign 4 u: u will find da baby wrapped in strips of cloth n lying in a manger."
Lk 2:13	And suddenly there wuz w da angel a multitude of da heavenly army, praising God n sayin’, 

Lk 2:14	"Glory 2 God in da highest, n on earth pce among ppl w whom he’s pleased!"

Lk 2:15	And it happened dat when da angels had departed from them into heaven, da shepherds began 2 tell 1 anotha, "Let us go now 2 Bethlehem n c dis thang dat’s happened, which da Lord haz revealed 2 us!"
Lk 2:16	And they went hurrying n found both Mary n Joey, n da baby who wuz lying in da manger.
Lk 2:17	And when they saw it, they made known da statement dat had been told 2 them 'bout dis kid.
Lk 2:18	And all who heard it were shook abt wut had been said 2 them by da shepherds.
Lk 2:19	But Mary treasured up all deez words, pondering them in her heart.
Lk 2:20	And da shepherds returned, glorifying n praising God 4 all dat they had heard n seen, just like it had been told 2 them. 

Lk 2:21	And when 8 days were completed so dat he could be cut, he wuz named Jesus, his name dat he wuz called by da angel b4 he wuz conceived in da womb. 

Lk 2:22	And when da days of their purification were completed accordin’ 2 da law of Moe, they brought him up 2 Jerusalem 2 present him 2 da Lord
Lk 2:23	(just like it’s written in da law of da Lord, "Every male dat opens da womb gonna be called holy 2 da Lord")
Lk 2:24	n 2 offer a sacrifice accordin’ 2 wut wuz stated in da law of da Lord, "a pair of turtledoves or 2 yung pigeons." 

Lk 2:25	And look, there wuz a man in Jerusalem whose name wuz Simeon, n dis man wuz gud n devout, looking forward 2 da consolation of Israel, n da Holy Spirit wuz on him.
Lk 2:26	And it had been revealed 2 him by da Holy Spirit dat he’d not c death b4 he’d c da Lord's Christ.
Lk 2:27	And he came in da Spirit into da temple, n when da parents brought in da kid Jesus so dat they could do 4 him accordin’ 2 wut wuz customary under da law,
Lk 2:28	he took him in his arms n praised God n said, 

Lk 2:29	"Now dismiss yo slave in pce, Lord, accordin’ 2 yo word.
Lk 2:30	Cuz my eyes hav seen yo salvation
Lk 2:31	dat u hav prepared in da presence of all da peoples,
Lk 2:32	a light 4 revelation 2 da Gentiles, n glory 2 yo ppl Israel."

Lk 2:33	And his dad n mom were shook at wut wuz said 'bout him.
Lk 2:34	And Simeon blessed them n said 2 his mom Mary, "Look, dis kid is appointed 4 da fall n rise of many in Israel, n 4 a sign dat’s opposed--
Lk 2:35	n a sword will pierce yo own soul also, so dat da thoughts of many hearts gonna be revealed!" 

Lk 2:36	And there wuz a prophetess, Anna da daughter of Phanuel of da tribe of Asher (she wuz advanced in yrs, having lived w her husband 7 yrs after her marriage,
Lk 2:37	n herself as a widow up 2 eighty-4 yrs) who didn't depart from da temple w fastings n prayers, serving night n day.
Lk 2:38	And at dat same hr she approached n began 2 give thanks 2 God, n 2 talk 'bout him 2 all those who were waiting 4 da redemption of Jerusalem. 

Lk 2:39	And when they had completed everythin’ accordin’ 2 da law of da Lord, they returned 2 Galilee, 2 their own town of Nazareth.
Lk 2:40	And da kid wuz growing n becoming strong, filled w wisdom, n da favor of God wuz on him. 

Lk 2:41	And his parents went every yr 2 Jerusalem 4 da feast of da Passover.
Lk 2:42	And when he wuz 12 yrs old, they went up accordin’ 2 da custom of da feast.
Lk 2:43	And after da days were completed, while they were returning, da boi Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem. And his parents didn't kno it,
Lk 2:44	but believing him 2 be in da group of travelers, they went a day's journey. And they began searching 4 him among their relatives n their acquaintances,
Lk 2:45	n when they didn't find him, they returned 2 Jerusalem 2 search 4 him.
Lk 2:46	And it happened dat after 3 days they found him in da temple courts, sitting in da midst of da teachers n listening 2 them n asking them questions.
Lk 2:47	And all who heard him were amazed at his insight n his answers.
Lk 2:48	And when they saw him, they were astounded n his mom said 2 him, "Kid, y hav u done dis 2 us? Look, yo dad n i’ve been searching 4 u anxiously!"
Lk 2:49	And he said 2 them, "Y were u searching 4 me? Did u not kno dat 'twas necessary 4 me 2 be in da house of my Dad?"
Lk 2:50	And they didn't understand da statement dat he spoke 2 them.
Lk 2:51	And he went down w them n came 2 Nazareth, n wuz submitting 2 them. And his mom treasured all deez tingz in her heart. 

Lk 2:52	And Jesus wuz advancing in wisdom n stature n in favor w God n w ppl. 


CHAPTER 3
Lk 3:1	Now in da 15th yr of da reign of Tiberius Caesar, when Pontius Pilate wuz governor of Judea, n Herod wuz tetrarch of Galilee, n his bro Phil wuz tetrarch of da region of Iturea n Trachonitis, n Lysanias wuz tetrarch of Abilene,
Lk 3:2	in da time of da high priest Annas n Caiaphas, da word of God came 2 Johnny da son of Zechariah in da wilderness.
Lk 3:3	And he went into all da surrounding region of da Jordan, preaching a baptism of repentance 4 da forgiveness of sins,
Lk 3:4	as it’s written in da book of da words of da prophet Isaiah, 
 "Da voice of 1 crying out in da wilderness, 'Prepare da wey of da Lord, make his paths straight!
Lk 3:5	Every valley gonna be filled, n every mountain n hill gonna be leveled, n da crooked will become straight, n da rough road will become smooth,
Lk 3:6	n all flesh will c da salvation of God.'"

Lk 3:7	So he wuz sayin’ 2 da crowds dat came out 2 be baptized by him, "Offspring of sneks! Who warned u 2 flee from da comin’ wrath?
Lk 3:8	So produce fruit worthy of repentance! And don’t begin 2 tell yoselves, 'We hav Abe as dad.' Cuz i tell u dat God is able 2 raise up kids 4 Abe from deez stones!
Lk 3:9	And even now da ax is positioned at da root of da trees; so every tree not producing gud fruit is cut down n yeeted into da fire." 

Lk 3:10	And da crowds were asking him, sayin’, "Wut then shud we do?"
Lk 3:11	And he answered n said 2 them, "Da 1 who haz 2 tunics must share w da 1 who doesn't hav 1, n da 1 who haz food must do like dat."
Lk 3:12	And tax collectors also came 2 be baptized, n they said 2 him, "Teacher, wut shud we do?"
Lk 3:13	And he said 2 them, "Collect no more than wut u r ordered 2."
Lk 3:14	And those who served in da army were also asking him, sayin’, "Wut shud we also do?" And he said 2 them, "Extort from nobody, n don’t blackmail anyone, n be content w yo pay." 

Lk 3:15	And while da ppl were waiting expectantly n all were pondering in their hearts abt Johnny, whether maybe he might be da Christ,
Lk 3:16	Johnny answered them all, sayin’, "i baptize u w water, but da 1 who is more powerful than im is comin’, of whom i ain’t worthy 2 untie da strap of his sandals. He will baptize u w da Holy Spirit n fire.
Lk 3:17	His winnowing shovel is in his hand, 2 clean out his threshing floor n 2 gather da wheat into his storehouse, but he’ll burn up da chaff w unquenchable fire." 

Lk 3:18	So w many other exhortations also he proclaimed gud news 2 da ppl.
Lk 3:19	But Herod da tetrarch, who had been reproved by him abt Herodias, his bro's wife, n abt all da bad deeds dat Herod had done,
Lk 3:20	added dis also 2 them all: he also locked up Johnny in jail. 

Lk 3:21	Now it happened dat when all da ppl were baptized, Jesus also wuz baptized, n while he wuz praying, heaven wuz opened,
Lk 3:22	n da Holy Spirit went down on him in bodily form like a dove, n a voice came from heaven, "U r my beloved Son; w u im well pleased." 

Lk 3:23	And Jesus, when he began his ministry, wuz himself 'bout thirty yrs old, bein’ da son (as 'twas believed) of Joey da son of Eli,
Lk 3:24	da son of Matthat, da son of Levi, da son of Melchi, da son of Jannai, da son of Joey,
Lk 3:25	da son of Mattathias, da son of Amos, da son of Nahum, da son of Esli, da son of Naggai,
Lk 3:26	da son of Maath, da son of Mattathias, da son of Semein, da son of Josech, da son of Joda,
Lk 3:27	da son of Joanan, da son of Rhesa, da son of Zerubbabel, da son of Shealtiel, da son of Neri,
Lk 3:28	da son of Melchi, da son of Addi, da son of Cosam, da son of Elmadam, da son of Er,
Lk 3:29	da son of Josh, da son of Eliezer, da son of Jorim, da son of Matthat, da son of Levi,
Lk 3:30	da son of Simeon, da son of Judah, da son of Joey, da son of Jonam, da son of Eliakim,
Lk 3:31	da son of Melea, da son of Menna, da son of Mattatha, da son of Nathan, da son of Dave,
Lk 3:32	da son of Jesse, da son of Obed, da son of Boaz, da son of Sala, da son of Nahshon,
Lk 3:33	da son of Amminadab, da son of Admin, da son of Arni, da son of Hezron, da son of Perez, da son of Judah,
Lk 3:34	da son of Jake, da son of Isaac, da son of Abe, da son of Terah, da son of Nahor,
Lk 3:35	da son of Serug, da son of Reu, da son of Peleg, da son of Eber, da son of Shelah,
Lk 3:36	da son of Cainan, da son of Arphaxad, da son of Shem, da son of Noah, da son of Lamech,
Lk 3:37	da son of Methuselah, da son of Enoch, da son of Jared, da son of Mahalaleel, da son of Cainan,
Lk 3:38	da son of Enosh, da son of Seth, da son of Adam, da son of God. 


CHAPTER 4
Lk 4:1	And Jesus, full of da Holy Spirit, returned from da Jordan n wuz led by da Spirit in da wilderness
Lk 4:2	forty days, bein’ tempted by da devil. And he ate nothin’ during those days, n when they were completed, he wuz hungry.
Lk 4:3	So da devil said 2 him, "If u r da Son of God, order dis stone dat it become bread!"
Lk 4:4	And Jesus replied 2 him, "It’s written, 'Man won’t live on bread alone.'" 

Lk 4:5	And he led him up n showed him all da kingdoms of da world in a moment of time.
Lk 4:6	And da devil said 2 him, "i’ll give u all dis domain n their glory, cuz it’s been handed over 2 me, n i can give it 2 whomever i want.
Lk 4:7	So if u will worship b4 me, all dis gonna be urs."
Lk 4:8	And Jesus answered n said 2 him, "It’s written, 'U will worship da Lord yo God, n serve only him.'" 

Lk 4:9	And he brought him 2 Jerusalem, n had him stand on da highest point of da temple n said 2 him, "If u r da Son of God, yeet yoself down from here,
Lk 4:10	4 it’s written, 
 'He will command his angels abt u, 2 protect u,'

Lk 4:11	n 
 'on their hands they’ll lift u up, lest u hit yo foot against a stone.'"

Lk 4:12	And Jesus answered n said 2 him, "It’s said, 'U aren’t 2 put 2 da test da Lord yo God.'"
Lk 4:13	And when da devil had completed every temptation, he departed from him until a favorable time. 

Lk 4:14	And Jesus returned in da power of da Spirit 2 Galilee, n news 'bout him went out throughout all da surrounding region.
Lk 4:15	And he began 2 teach in their synagogues, n wuz praised by all. 

Lk 4:16	And he came 2 Nazareth, where he had been brought up, n accordin’ 2 his custom he entered into da synagogue on da day of da Sabbath n stood up 2 read.
Lk 4:17	And da scroll of da prophet Isaiah wuz given 2 him, n unrolling da scroll he found da place where 'twas written, 

Lk 4:18	"Da Spirit of da Lord is on me, cuz of which he’s anointed me 2 proclaim gud news 2 da poor. He haz sent me 2 proclaim release 2 da captives, n recovery of sight 2 da blind, 2 send out in freedom those who r oppressed,
Lk 4:19	2 proclaim da favorable yr of da Lord."

Lk 4:20	And he rolled up da scroll n gave it back 2 da attendant n sat down. And da eyes of e’erybody in da synagogue were looking intently at him.
Lk 4:21	And he began 2 tell them, "2day dis scripture haz been fulfilled in yo hearing."
Lk 4:22	And they were all talkin’ well of him, n were shook at da gracious words dat were comin’ out of his mouth. And they were sayin’, "Is dis man not da son of Joey?"
Lk 4:23	And he said 2 them, "Doubtless u will tell me dis parable: 'Physician, heal yoself!' Whatever we've heard dat took place in Capernaum, do here in yo hometown also!"
Lk 4:24	And he said, "TBH no prophet is acceptable in his own hometown.
Lk 4:25	But in truth i tell u, there were many widows in Israel in da days of Elijah, when da sky wuz shut 4 3 yrs n 6 months while a great famine took place over all da land.
Lk 4:26	And Elijah wuz sent 2 none of them, but only 2 Zarephath in da region of Sidon, 2 a woman who wuz a widow.
Lk 4:27	And there were many lepers in Israel in da time of da prophet Elisha, n none of them wuz made clean except Naaman da Syrian."
Lk 4:28	And all those in da synagogue were filled w anger when they heard deez tingz.
Lk 4:29	And they stood up n forced him out of da town n brought him up 2 da edge of da hill on which their town wuz built, so dat they could yeet him down da cliff.
Lk 4:30	But he passed thru their midst n went on his wey. 

Lk 4:31	And he came down 2 Capernaum, a town of Galilee, n wuz teaching them on da Sabbath.
Lk 4:32	And they were astounded at his teaching, cuz he spoke w authority. 

Lk 4:33	And in da synagogue there wuz a man who had da spirit of an dirty demon, n he cried out w a loud voice,
Lk 4:34	"Ha! Leave us alone, Jesus da Nazarene! Hav u come 2 destroy us? i kno who u r--da Holy 1 of God!"
Lk 4:35	And Jesus roasted him, sayin’, "Be silent n come out of him!" And after throwing him down in their midst, da demon came out of him without hurting him at all.
Lk 4:36	And amazement came on them all, n they began 2 talk w 1 anotha, sayin’, "Wut word is dis? Cuz he commands da dirty spirits w authority n power, n they come out!"
Lk 4:37	And news 'bout him went out into every place of da surrounding region. 

Lk 4:38	And after he set out from da synagogue, he went into Simon's house. And Simon's mom-in-law wuz afflicted w a high fever, n they asked him on behalf of her.
Lk 4:39	And he stood over her n roasted da fever, n it left her. And immediately she got up n began 2 serve them. 

Lk 4:40	Now as da sun wuz setting, all who had those who were sick w various diseases brought them 2 him, n placing his hands on every 1 of them, he healed them.
Lk 4:41	And demons also were comin’ out of many, crying out n sayin’, "U r da Son of God!" And he roasted them n didn't permit them 2 talk, cuz they knew dat he wuz da Christ. 

Lk 4:42	And when 'twas day, he departed n went 2 an isolated place. And da crowds were seeking him, n came 2 him n were trying 2 prevent him from departing from them.
Lk 4:43	But he said 2 them, "It’s necessary 4 me 2 proclaim da gud news of da kingdom of God 2 da other towns also, cuz i wuz sent 4 dis purpose.
Lk 4:44	And he wuz preaching in da synagogues of Judea. 


CHAPTER 5
Lk 5:1	Now it happened dat while da crowd wuz pressing around him n hearing da word of God, he wuz standing beside da lake of Gennesaret,
Lk 5:2	n he saw 2 boats there beside da lake, but da fishermen had gotten out of them n were washing their nets.
Lk 5:3	And he got into 1 of da boats, which wuz Simon's, n asked him 2 put out from da land a lil’. And he sat down n began 2 teach da crowds from da boat.
Lk 5:4	And when he stopped talkin’, he said 2 Simon, "Put out into da deep water n let down yo nets 4 a catch."
Lk 5:5	And Simon answered n said, "Master, even tho we worked hard thru da whole night, we caught nothin’. But at yo word i’ll let down da nets."
Lk 5:6	And when they did dis, they caught a very large numba of fish, n their nets began 2 tear.
Lk 5:7	And they signaled 2 their partners in da other boat 2 come n help them, n they came n filled both da boats so dat they began 2 sink.
Lk 5:8	And when he saw it, Simon Pete fell down at Jesus' knees, sayin’, "Depart from me, Lord, cuz im a sinful man!"
Lk 5:9	Cuz amazement had seized him n all those who were w him at da catch of fish dat they had caught,
Lk 5:10	n so also were James n Johnny, da sons of Zebedee, who were business partners w Simon. And Jesus said 2 Simon, "Don’t be afraid! From now on u gonna be catching ppl!"
Lk 5:11	And after they brought their boats 2 da land, they left everythin’ n followed him. 

Lk 5:12	And it happened dat while he wuz in 1 of da towns, there wuz a man covered w leprosy. And when he saw Jesus, he fell down on his face n begged him, sayin’, "Lord, if u r willing, u r able 2 make me clean."
Lk 5:13	And extending his hand he touched him, sayin’, "im willing; be clean." And immediately da leprosy went away from him.
Lk 5:14	And he ordered him, "Tell nobody, but go n show yoself 2 da priest n bring da offering 4 yo cleansing just like Moe commanded, 4 a testimony 2 them.
Lk 5:15	But da report 'bout him spread even more, n large crowds were gathering 2 hear him n 2 be healed of their illnesses.
Lk 5:16	But he himself wuz withdrawing in da wilderness n praying. 

Lk 5:17	And it happened dat on 1 of da days as he wuz teaching, Pharisees n teachers of da law were sitting there who had come from every village of Galilee n Judea n from Jerusalem, n da power of da Lord wuz there in order 4 him 2 heal.
Lk 5:18	And look, men came carrying on a stretcher a man who wuz paralyzed, n they were seeking 2 bring him in n place him b4 him.
Lk 5:19	And when they didn't find a wey 2 bring him in cuz of da crowd, they went up on da roof n let him down thru da roof tiles w da stretcher into da midst of them, in front of Jesus.
Lk 5:20	And when he saw their faith, he said, "Friend, yo sins r forgiven u."
Lk 5:21	And da scribes n da Pharisees began 2 reason, sayin’, "Who is dis man who speaks blasphemies? Who is able 2 forgive sins except God alone?"
Lk 5:22	But Jesus, perceiving their thoughts, answered n said 2 them, "Y r u reasoning in yo hearts?
Lk 5:23	Which is easier 2 say, 'Yo sins r forgiven u,' or 2 say, 'Get up n walk?'
Lk 5:24	But so dat u may kno dat da Son of Man haz authority on earth 2 forgive sins," he said 2 da 1 who wuz paralyzed, "i tell u, 'Get up n pick up yo stretcher n go 2 yo home.'"
Lk 5:25	And immediately he stood up b4 them, picked up wut he had been lying on, n went away 2 his home, glorifying God.
Lk 5:26	And amazement seized them all, n they began 2 glorify God. And they were filled w fear, sayin’, "We hav seen wonderful tingz 2day!" 

Lk 5:27	And after deez tingz, he went out n saw a tax collector named Levi sitting at da tax booth, n he said 2 him, "Follow me!"
Lk 5:28	And leaving everythin’ behind, he got up n began 2 follow him. 

Lk 5:29	And Levi gave a great banquet 4 him in his house, n there wuz a large crowd of tax collectors n others who were reclining 4 da meal w them.
Lk 5:30	And da Pharisees n their scribes began 2 complain 2 his homies, sayin’, "Y do u eat n drink w da tax collectors n sinners?"
Lk 5:31	And Jesus answered n said 2 them, "Those who r healthy don’t hav need of a doc, but those who r sick.
Lk 5:32	i haven't come 2 call da gud but sinners 2 repentance." 

Lk 5:33	And they said 2 him, "Da homeboys of Johnny fast often n make prayers--like dat also da homeboys of da Pharisees--but urs r eating n drinking!"
Lk 5:34	So he said 2 them, "U aren’t able 2 make da bridegroom's attendants fast as long as da bridegroom is w them, r u?
Lk 5:35	But days will come, n when da bridegroom is taken away from them, then they’ll fast in those days."
Lk 5:36	And he also told a parable 2 them: "No 1 tears a patch from a new garment n puts it on an old garment. Otherwise, he’ll hav torn da new also, n da old won’t match da patch dat’s from da new.
Lk 5:37	And nobody pours new wine into old wineskins. Otherwise, da new wine will burst da wineskins, n it gonna be spilled n da wineskins gonna be destroyed.
Lk 5:38	But new wine gotta be put into new wineskins.
Lk 5:39	And nobody after drinking old wine wants new, cuz he says, 'Da old is just fine!'" 


CHAPTER 6
Lk 6:1	Now it happened dat on a Sabbath he went thru da grain fields, n his homies were picking n eating da heads of grain, rubbing them in their hands.
Lk 6:2	But some of da Pharisees said, "Y r u doin’ wut isn’t ok on da Sabbath?
Lk 6:3	And Jesus answered n said 2 them, "Hav u not read dis, wut Dave did when he n those who were w him were hungry--
Lk 6:4	how he entered into da house of God n took da bread of da presentation, which it isn’t ok 2 eat (except da priests alone), n ate it n gave it 2 those w him?"
Lk 6:5	And he said 2 them, "Da Son of Man is Lord of da Sabbath." 

Lk 6:6	Now it happened dat on anotha Sabbath he entered into da synagogue n wuz teaching, n a man wuz there, n his right hand wuz withered.
Lk 6:7	So da scribes n da Pharisees were watching closely 2 c if he’d heal on da Sabbath, so dat they could find a reason 2 accuse him.
Lk 6:8	But he knew their thoughts n said 2 da man who had da withered hand, "Get up n stand in da middle," n he got up n stood there.
Lk 6:9	And Jesus said 2 them, "i ask u whether it’s permitted on da Sabbath 2 do gud or 2 do bad, 2 save a lyf or 2 destroy it?"
Lk 6:10	And after looking around at them all, he said 2 him, "Stretch out yo hand," n he did, n his hand wuz restored.
Lk 6:11	But they were filled w fury, n began discussing w 1 anotha wut they might do 2 Jesus. 

Lk 6:12	Now it happened dat in deez days he went away 2 da mountain 2 pray, n wuz spending da whole night in prayer 2 God.
Lk 6:13	And when day came, he summoned his homies n chose from them 12, whom he also named apostles:
Lk 6:14	Simon (whom he also named Pete) n his bro Andrew, n James, n Johnny, n Phil, n Bartholomew,
Lk 6:15	n Matty, n Tommy, n James da son of Alphaeus, n Simon who wuz called da Zealot,
Lk 6:16	n Judas da son of James, n Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor. 

Lk 6:17	And he came down w them n stood on a level place, n a large crowd of his homeboys n a great multitude of ppl from all of Judea n Jerusalem n da seacoast district of Tyre n Sidon,
Lk 6:18	who came 2 hear him n 2 be healed of their diseases, n those who were troubled by dirty spirits were cured.
Lk 6:19	And da whole crowd wuz seeking 2 touch him, cuz power wuz goin’ out from him n healing them all. 

Lk 6:20	And he lifted up his eyes 2 his homies n said, 
 "Blessed r da poor, cuz urs is da kingdom of God.
Lk 6:21	Blessed r those who r hungry now, cuz u gonna be satisfied. Blessed r those who cri now, Cuz u will laugh.
Lk 6:22	Blessed r u when ppl h8 u, n when they exclude u n revile u n spurn yo name as bad on account of da Son of Man.
Lk 6:23	Rejoice in dat day, n leap 4 happiness, 4 look, yo reward is great in heaven. Cuz their dads used 2 do da same tingz 2 da prophets.

Lk 6:24	"But damn u who r rich, cuz u hav received yo comfort.
Lk 6:25	Damn u who r satisfied now, cuz u gonna be hungry. Woe, u who laugh now, cuz u will mourn n cri.
Lk 6:26	Woe whenever all ppl talk well of u, 4 their dads used 2 do da same tingz 2 da false prophets.

Lk 6:27	"But 2 u who r listening i say: Luv yo enemies, do gud 2 those who h8 u,
Lk 6:28	bless those who curse u, pray 4 those who mistreat u.
Lk 6:29	2 da 1 who hits u on da cheek, offer da other also, n from da 1 who takes away yo cloak, don’t withhold yo tunic also.
Lk 6:30	Give 2 e’erybody who asks u, n from da 1 who takes away yo tingz, don’t ask 4 them back.
Lk 6:31	And just like u want ppl 2 do 2 u, do da same 2 them. 

Lk 6:32	"And if u luv those who luv u, wut kind of credit is dat 2 u? Cuz even sinners luv those who luv them!
Lk 6:33	And if u do gud 2 those who do gud 2 u, wut kind of credit is dat 2 u? Even da sinners do da same!
Lk 6:34	And if u lend 2 those from whom u expect 2 get back, wut kind of credit is dat 2 u? Even sinners lend 2 sinners, so dat they may get back an equal amount!
Lk 6:35	But luv yo enemies, n do gud, n lend expecting back nothin’, n yo reward gonna be great, n u gonna be sons of da Most High, cuz he’s kind 2 da ungrateful n wicked.
Lk 6:36	Be merciful, just like yo Dad is merciful! 

Lk 6:37	"And don’t judge, n u will never be judged. And don’t condemn, n u will never be condemned. Pardon, n u gonna be pardoned.
Lk 6:38	Give, n it gonna be given 2 u, a gud measure--pressed down, shaken, overflowing--they’ll pour out into yo lap. Cuz w da measure by which u measure out, it gonna be measured out 2 u in return." 

Lk 6:39	And he also told them a parable: "Ofc a blind person can’t lead da blind, can he? Will they not both fall into a pit?
Lk 6:40	A homeboy isn’t superior 2 his teacher, but e’erybody, when he’s fully trained, gonna be like his teacher.
Lk 6:41	And y do u c da speck dat’s in yo bro's eye, but don’t notice da beam of wood dat’s in yo own eye?
Lk 6:42	How r u able 2 tell yo bro, "Bro, allow me 2 remove da speck dat’s in yo eye," while u yoself don’t c da beam of wood in yo own eye? Hypocrite! 1st remove da beam of wood from yo own eye, n then u will c clearly 2 remove da speck dat’s in yo bro's eye! 

Lk 6:43	"Cuz there’s no gud tree dat produces bad fruit, nor on da other hand a bad tree dat produces gud fruit,
Lk 6:44	4 each tree is known by its own fruit. Cuz figs aren’t gathered from thorn plants, nor r grapes harvested from thorn bushes.
Lk 6:45	Da gud person out of da gud treasury of his heart brings forth gud, n da bad person out of his bad treasury brings forth bad. Cuz out of da abundance of da heart his mouth speaks. 

Lk 6:46	"And y do u call me 'Lord, Lord,' n don’t do wut i tell u? 

Lk 6:47	"E’erybody who comes 2 me n listens 2 my words n does them--i’ll show u wut he’s like:
Lk 6:48	he’s like a man building a house, who dug n went down deep n laid da foundation on da rock. And when a flood came, da river burst against dat house n wasn’t able 2 shake it, cuz it had been built well.
Lk 6:49	But da 1 who hears my words n doesn't do them is like a man who built a house on da ground without a foundation, which da river burst against, n immediately it collapsed--n da collapse of dat house wuz great!" 


CHAPTER 7
Lk 7:1	After he had finished all his statements in da hearing of da ppl, he entered into Capernaum.
Lk 7:2	Now a certain centurion's slave, who wuz esteemed by him, wuz sick n wuz 'bout 2 die.
Lk 7:3	So when he heard 'bout Jesus, he sent Jewish elders 2 him, asking him dat he’d come n cure his slave.
Lk 7:4	And when they came 2 Jesus, they began begging him earnestly, sayin’, "He is worthy dat u grant dis 4 him,
Lk 7:5	cuz he luvs our nation n he himself built da synagogue 4 us."
Lk 7:6	So Jesus went w them. Now by dis time he wasn’t far away from da house, n da centurion sent friends, sayin’ 2 him, "Lord, don’t trouble yoself, cuz i ain’t worthy dat u shud come in under my roof.
Lk 7:7	Cuz of dis reason neither did i consider myself worthy 2 come 2 u. But say da word n my slave gotta be healed.
Lk 7:8	Cuz i also am a man placed under authority, who haz soldiers under me, n i tell dis 1, 'Go!' n he goes, n 2 anotha 1, 'Come!' n he comes, n 2 my slave, 'Do dis!' n he does it." 

Lk 7:9	And when Jesus heard deez tingz, he marveled at him, n turning around 2 da crowd dat wuz following him, he said, "i tell u, not even in Israel hav i found such great faith!"
Lk 7:10	And when they returned 2 da house, those who had been sent found da slave healthy. 

Lk 7:11	And it happened dat on da next day he went 2 a town called Nain, n his homies n a large crowd went w him.
Lk 7:12	And as he approached da gate of da town, look, a man who had died wuz bein’ carried out, his mom's only son, n she wuz a widow. And a large crowd from da town wuz w her.
Lk 7:13	And when da Lord saw her, he had compassion 4 her n said 2 her, "Don’t cri!"
Lk 7:14	And he came up n touched da bier, n those who were carrying it stopped. And he said, "Yung man, i tell u, get up!"
Lk 7:15	And da ded man sat up n began 2 talk, n he gave him 2 his mom.
Lk 7:16	And fear seized them all, n they began 2 glorify God, sayin’, "A great prophet haz appeared among us!" n "God haz visited 2 help his ppl!"
Lk 7:17	And dis report 'bout him went out in da whole of Judea n in all da surrounding region. 

Lk 7:18	And his homeboys reported 2 Johnny 'bout all deez tingz. And summoning a certain 2 of his homeboys, Johnny
Lk 7:19	sent them 2 da Lord, sayin’, "R u da 1 who is 2 come, or shud we look 4 anotha?"
Lk 7:20	And when da men came 2 him, they said, "Johnny da Baptist sent us 2 u, sayin’, 'R u da 1 who is 2 come, or shud we look 4 anotha?'"
Lk 7:21	In dat hr he healed many ppl of diseases n suffering n bad spirits, n he granted sight 2 many blind ppl.
Lk 7:22	And he answered n said 2 them, "Go n tell Johnny wut u hav seen n heard: da blind get sight, da lame walk, lepers r cleansed, da deaf hear; da ded r raised, da poor hav gud news announced 2 them.
Lk 7:23	And whoever isn’t offended by me is blessed." 

Lk 7:24	And when da messengers of Johnny had departed, he began 2 talk 2 da crowds abt Johnny: "Wut did u go out into da wilderness 2 c? A reed shaken by da wind?
Lk 7:25	But wut did u go out 2 c? A man dressed in soft clothing? Look, those who r in splendid clothing n luxury r in da royal palaces.
Lk 7:26	But wut did u go out 2 c? A prophet? Yeah, i tell u, n even more than a prophet!
Lk 7:27	It’s dis man 'bout whom it’s written: 
 'Look, im sending my messenger b4 yo face, who will prepare yo wey b4 u.'

Lk 7:28	i tell u, there’s nobody better among those born of women than Johnny, but da 1 who is least in da kingdom of God is better than he.
Lk 7:29	(And all da ppl, when they heard dis--even da tax collectors--affirmed da righteousness of God, cuz they had been baptized w da baptism of Johnny,
Lk 7:30	but da Pharisees n da legal experts rejected da purpose of God 4 themselves, cuz they hadn't been baptized by him.) 

Lk 7:31	"2 wut then will i compare da ppl of dis generation, n wut r they like?
Lk 7:32	They r like kids sitting in da marketplace n calling out 2 1 anotha, who say, 
 'We played da flute 4 u n u didn't dance; we sang a be sad n u didn't cri.'

Lk 7:33	Cuz Johnny da Baptist haz come not eating bread or drinking wine, n u say, 'He haz a demon!'
Lk 7:34	Da Son of Man haz come eating n drinking, n u say, 'Look, a man who is a glutton n a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors n sinners!'
Lk 7:35	And wisdom is vindicated by all her kids." 

Lk 7:36	Now 1 of da Pharisees asked him 2 eat w him, n he entered into da house of da Pharisee n reclined at da table.
Lk 7:37	And look, a woman in da town who wuz a sinner, when she learned dat he wuz dining in da Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster flask of perfumed oil,
Lk 7:38	n standing behind him at his feet weepin’, she began 2 wet his feet w her tears n wuz wiping them w da hair of her head n wuz kissing his feet n anointing them w da perfumed oil.
Lk 7:39	Now when da Pharisee who invited him saw dis, he spoke 2 himself, sayin’, "If dis man were a prophet, he’d hav known who n wut kind of woman dis is who is touching him, dat she’s a sinner."
Lk 7:40	And Jesus answered n said 2 him, "Simon, i’ve somethin’ 2 tell u." And he said, "Teacher, say it."
Lk 7:41	"There were 2 debtors who owed a certain creditor. 1 owed 5 hundred denarii n da other fifty.
Lk 7:42	When they weren't able 2 repay him, he forgave da debts of both. Now which of them will luv him more?"
Lk 7:43	Simon answered n said, "i suppose dat it’s da 1 2 whom he forgave more." And he said 2 him, "U hav judged correctly."
Lk 7:44	And turning toward da woman, he said 2 Simon, "Do u c dis woman? i entered into yo house. U didn't gimme water 4 my feet, but she wet my feet w her tears n wiped them w her hair.
Lk 7:45	U didn't gimme a kiss, but from da time i entered, she hasn't stopped kissing my feet.
Lk 7:46	U didn't anoint my head w olive oil, but she anointed my feet w perfumed oil.
Lk 7:47	Cuz of dis reason i tell u, her sins--which were many--hav been forgiven, 4 she luvd much. But da 1 2 whom lil’ is forgiven luvs lil’."
Lk 7:48	And he said 2 her, "Yo sins r forgiven."
Lk 7:49	And those who were reclining at da table w him began 2 say among themselves, "Who is dis who even forgives sins?"
Lk 7:50	And he said 2 da woman, "Yo faith haz saved u. Go in pce." 


CHAPTER 8
Lk 8:1	And it happened dat afterward also he wuz goin’ 'bout from 1 town n village 2 anotha preaching n proclaiming da gud news abt da kingdom of God, n da 12 were w him,
Lk 8:2	n some women who had been healed of bad spirits n diseases: Mary (who wuz called Magdalene), from whom 7 demons had gone out,
Lk 8:3	n Joanna da wife of Chuza (Herod's household manager), n Susanna, n many others who were helping 2 support them from their possessions. 

Lk 8:4	And while a large crowd wuz gathering n they were goin’ 2 him from town after town, he spoke by means of a parable:
Lk 8:5	"Da sower went out 2 sow his seed, n while he wuz sowing, some seed fell on da side of da path n wuz trampled under foot, n da birbs of da sky devoured it.
Lk 8:6	And other seed fell on da rock, n when it came up, it withered, cuz it didn't hav moisture.
Lk 8:7	And other seed fell in da midst of da thorn plants, n da thorn plants grew up w it n choked it.
Lk 8:8	And other seed fell on da gud soil, n when it came up, it produced a hundred times as much grain." As he said deez tingz, he called out, "Da 1 who haz ears 2 hear, let him hear!" 

Lk 8:9	And his homies asked him wut dis parable meant.
Lk 8:10	And he said, "2 u it’s been given 2 kno da mysteries of da kingdom of God, but 2 da rest they’re in parables, so dat 
 'Seeing they may not c, n hearing they may not understand.'

Lk 8:11	Now da parable means dis: da seed is da word of God,
Lk 8:12	n those beside da path r da ones who hav heard. Then da devil comes n takes away da word from their heart, so dat they may not believe n be saved.
Lk 8:13	And those on da rock r those who get da word w happiness when they hear it, n deez don’t hav enough root, who believe 4 a time n in a time of testing fall away.
Lk 8:14	And da seed dat fell into da thorn plants--deez r da ones who hear n as they go along r choked by da worries n riches n pleasures of lyf, n they don’t bear fruit 2 maturity.
Lk 8:15	But da seed on da gud soil--deez r da ones who, after hearing da word, hold fast 2 it w a noble n gud heart, n bear fruit w patient endurance. 

Lk 8:16	"And nobody, after lighting a lamp, covers it w a jar or puts it under a bed, but puts it on a lampstand, so dat those who come in can c da light.
Lk 8:17	Cuz nothin’ is secret dat’ll not become evident, n nothin’ hidden dat’ll never be known n come 2 light.
Lk 8:18	So consider how u listen, 4 whoever haz, 2 him more gonna be given, n whoever doesn't hav, even wut he thinks dat he’s gonna be taken away from him." 

Lk 8:19	Now his mom n bros came 2 him, n they weren't able 2 meet w him cuz of da crowd.
Lk 8:20	And 'twas reported 2 him, "Yo mom n yo bros r standing outside wanting 2 c u."
Lk 8:21	But he answered n said 2 them, "Deez r my mom n my bros--da ones who hear da word of God n do it. 

Lk 8:22	Now it happened dat on 1 of da days both he n his homeboys got into a boat, n he said 2 them, "Let us cross over 2 da other side of da lake." And they set sail,
Lk 8:23	n as they were sailing, he fell asleep. And a storm of wind came down on da lake, n they were bein’ swamped n were in danger.
Lk 8:24	And they came n woke him up, sayin’, "Master, master! We r dyin’!" So he got up n roasted da wind n da billowing waves of water n they ceased, n it became calm.
Lk 8:25	And he said 2 them, "Where is yo faith?" But they were afraid n were shook, sayin’ 2 1 anotha, "Who then is dis, dat he commands even da winds n da water n they obey him?" 

Lk 8:26	And they sailed 2 da region of da Gerasenes, which is opposite Galilee.
Lk 8:27	And as he got out on da land, a certain man from da town met him who had demons n 4 a considerable time hadn't worn clothes n didn't live in a house, but among da tombs.
Lk 8:28	And when he saw Jesus, he cried out, fell down b4 him, n said w a loud voice, "Wut do i’ve 2 do w u, Jesus, Son of da Most High God? i beg u, don’t torment me!"
Lk 8:29	Cuz he had commanded da dirty spirit 2 come out of da man. (Cuz it had seized him many times, n he wuz bound w chains n shackles n wuz guarded, n breaking da bonds he’d be driven by da demon into da deserted places.)
Lk 8:30	So Jesus asked him, "Wut is yo name?" And he said, "Legion," cuz many demons had entered into him.
Lk 8:31	And they began begging him dat he’d not order them 2 depart into da abyss.
Lk 8:32	Now there wuz a large herd of pigs feeding there on da hill, n they begged him dat he’d permit them 2 enter into those pigs. And he permitted them.
Lk 8:33	So da demons came out of da man n entered into da pigs, n da herd rushed headlong down da steep slope into da lake n were drowned.
Lk 8:34	And when da herdsmen saw wut had happened, they fled n reported it in da town n in da countryside.
Lk 8:35	So they went out 2 c wut had happened, n they came 2 Jesus n found da man from whom da demons had gone out sitting there clothed n in his right mind, at da feet of Jesus, n they were afraid.
Lk 8:36	And those who had seen it reported 2 them how da man who had been demon-possessed had been healed.
Lk 8:37	And all da ppl of da surrounding region of da Gerasenes asked him 2 depart from them, cuz they had been seized w great fear. So he got into da boat n returned.
Lk 8:38	And da man from who da demons had gone out wuz begging him 2 stay w him, but he sent him away, sayin’,
Lk 8:39	"Return 2 yo home n tell all dat God haz done 4 u." And he went away, proclaiming throughout da whole town all dat Jesus had done 4 him. 

Lk 8:40	Now when Jesus returned, da crowd welcomed him, cuz they were all waiting 4 him.
Lk 8:41	And look, a man who wuz named Jairus came, n dis man wuz a ruler of da synagogue. And he fell down at da feet of Jesus n began begging him 2 come 2 his house,
Lk 8:42	cuz he had an only daughter, 'bout 12 yrs old, n she wuz dying. 
 Now as he wuz goin’, da crowds were pressing against him.
Lk 8:43	And a woman who wuz suffering from hemorrhages 4 12 yrs (who, even tho she had spent all her assets on docs, wasn’t able 2 be healed by anyone)
Lk 8:44	came up behind him n touched da edge of his cloak, n immediately her hemorrhaging stopped.
Lk 8:45	And Jesus said, "Who is da 1 who touched me?" And when they all denied it, Pete said, "Master, da crowds r pressing u hard n crowding u!"
Lk 8:46	But Jesus said, "Someone touched me, cuz i kno power haz gone out from me."
Lk 8:47	And when da woman saw dat she didn't escape notice, she came trembling n falling down b4 him. In da presence of all da ppl, she told 4 wut reason she had touched him, n dat she wuz healed immediately.
Lk 8:48	And he said 2 her, "Daughter, yo faith haz saved u. Go in pce." 

Lk 8:49	While he wuz still talkin’, someone came from da synagogue ruler's house, sayin’, "Yo daughter is ded! Trouble da Teacher no longer!"
Lk 8:50	But Jesus, when he heard dis, replied 2 him, "Don’t be afraid! Only believe, n she gonna be healed."
Lk 8:51	Now when he came 2 da house, he didn't allow anyone 2 enter w him except Pete n Johnny n James n da dad n mom of da kid.
Lk 8:52	And they were all weepin’ n mourning 4 her, but he said, "Don’t cri! Cuz she isn’t ded, but is sleeping."
Lk 8:53	And they began laughing at him, cuz they knew dat she wuz ded.
Lk 8:54	But he took her hand n called, sayin’, "Kid, get up."
Lk 8:55	And her spirit returned, n she got up immediately, n he ordered somethin’ 2 be given 2 her 2 eat.
Lk 8:56	And her parents were shook, but he ordered them 2 tell nobody wut had happened. 


CHAPTER 9
Lk 9:1	And summoning da 12, he gave them power n authority over all da demons n 2 cure diseases,
Lk 9:2	n he sent them out 2 proclaim da kingdom of God n 2 heal da sick.
Lk 9:3	And he said 2 them, "Take along nothin’ 4 da journey--neither a staff, nor a traveler's bag, nor bread, nor money, nor 2 hav 2 tunics apiece.
Lk 9:4	And into whatever house u enter, stay there n depart from there.
Lk 9:5	And as 4 all those who don’t welcome u--when u depart from dat town, shake off da dust from yo feet 4 a testimony against them."
Lk 9:6	So they departed n went throughout da villages, proclaiming da gud news n healing everywhere. 

Lk 9:7	Now Herod da tetrarch heard 'bout all dat wuz happening, n he wuz greatly perplexed, cuz 'twas said by some dat Johnny haz been raised from da ded,
Lk 9:8	n by some dat Elijah had appeared, n others dat some prophet of ancient times had risen.
Lk 9:9	And Herod said, "Johnny i beheaded, but who is dis 'bout whom i hear such tingz?" And he wuz wanting 2 c him. 

Lk 9:10	And when they returned, da apostles described 2 him all dat they had done. And he took them along n withdrew privately 2 a town called Bethsaida.
Lk 9:11	But when da crowds found out, they followed him, n welcoming them, he began 2 talk 2 them 'bout da kingdom of God, n he cured those who had need of healing.
Lk 9:12	Now da day began 2 be far spent, n da 12 came up n said 2 him, "Send away da crowd so dat they can go into da surrounding villages n farms 2 obtain lodging n find provisions, cuz we're here in a desolate place.
Lk 9:13	But he said 2 them, "U give them somethin’ 2 eat!" And they said, "We hav no more than 5 loaves n 2 fish, unless maybe we go n purchase food 4 all deez ppl."
Lk 9:14	(Cuz there were 'bout 5 K men.) So he said 2 his homeboys, "Hav them sit down in groups of 'bout fifty each."
Lk 9:15	And they did so, n had them all sit down.
Lk 9:16	And taking da 5 loaves n da 2 fish, n looking up 2 heaven, he gave thanks n broke them n began giving them 2 da homies 2 set b4 da crowd.
Lk 9:17	And they all ate n were satisfied, n wut wuz left over wuz picked up by them--12 baskets of broken pieces. 

Lk 9:18	And it happened dat while he wuz praying alone, da homies were w him. And he asked them, sayin’, "Who do da crowds say dat im?"
Lk 9:19	And they answered n said, "Johnny da Baptist, but others, Elijah, n others, dat 1 of da ancient prophets haz risen."
Lk 9:20	And he said 2 them, "But who do u say dat im?" And Pete answered n said, "Da Christ of God." 

Lk 9:21	But he warned n commanded them 2 tell dis 2 nobody,
Lk 9:22	sayin’, "It’s necessary 4 da Son of Man 2 suffer many tingz n 2 be rejected by da elders n chief priests n scribes, n 2 be killed, n 2 be raised on da 3rd day. 

Lk 9:23	And he said 2 them all, "If anyone wants 2 come after me, he must deny himself n take up his cross every day n follow me.
Lk 9:24	Cuz whoever wants 2 save his lyf will lose it, but whoever loses his lyf on account of me, dis person will save it.
Lk 9:25	Cuz wut is a person benefited if he gains da whole world but loses or forfeits himself?
Lk 9:26	Cuz whoever is ashamed of me n my words, da Son of Man gonna be ashamed of dis person when he comes in his glory n da glory of da Dad n of da holy angels.
Lk 9:27	But i tell u fr, there r some of those standing here who will never experience death until they c da kingdom of God." 

Lk 9:28	Now it happened dat 'bout 8 days after deez words, he took along Pete n Johnny n James n went up on da mountain 2 pray.
Lk 9:29	And as he wuz praying, da appearance of his face became different, n his clothing became white, gleaming like lightning.
Lk 9:30	And look, 2 men were talking w him, who were Moe n Elijah,
Lk 9:31	who appeared in glory n were talkin’ 'bout his departure which he wuz 'bout 2 fulfill in Jerusalem. 

Lk 9:32	Now Pete n those w him were sleepy af, but when they became fully awake, they saw his glory n da 2 men who were standing w him.
Lk 9:33	And it happened dat as they were goin’ away from him, Pete said 2 Jesus, "Master, it’s gud 4 us 2 be here. And let’s make 3 shelters, 1 4 u n 1 4 Moe n 1 4 Elijah," not knowing wut he wuz sayin’.
Lk 9:34	And while he wuz sayin’ deez tingz, a cloud came n overshadowed them, n they were afraid as they entered into da cloud.
Lk 9:35	And a voice came from da cloud, sayin’, "Dis is my Son, my Chosen 1. Listen 2 him!"
Lk 9:36	And after da voice had occurred, Jesus wuz found alone. And they kept silent n told nobody in those days anythin’ of wut they had seen. 

Lk 9:37	Now it happened dat on da next day, when they had come down from da mountain, a large crowd met him.
Lk 9:38	And look, a man from da crowd cried out, sayin’, "Teacher, i beg u 2 look w concern on my son, cuz he’s my only son!
Lk 9:39	And look, a spirit seizes him n suddenly he screams, n it convulses him w foam n rarely withdraws from him, battering him severely.
Lk 9:40	And i begged yo homies dat they’d expel it, n they weren't able 2 do so."
Lk 9:41	So Jesus answered n said, "O unbelieving n perverted generation! How long will i be w u n put up w u? Bring yo son here!"
Lk 9:42	And while he wuz still approaching, da demon yote him down n convulsed him. But Jesus roasted da dirty spirit n healed da boi, n gave him back 2 his dad.
Lk 9:43	And they were all astounded at da impressiveness of God. 

Lk 9:44	"U take deez words 2 heart, 4 da Son of Man is 'bout 2 be betrayed into da hands of men."
Lk 9:45	But they didn't understand dis statement, n 'twas concealed from them so dat they couldn't understand it. And they were afraid 2 ask him 'bout dis statement. 

Lk 9:46	And an argument developed among them as 2 who of them might be best.
Lk 9:47	But Jesus, cuz he knew da thoughts of their hearts, took hold of a kid n had him stand beside him
Lk 9:48	n said 2 them, "Whoever welcomes dis kid in my name welcomes me, n whoever welcomes me welcomes da 1 who sent me. Cuz da 1 who is least among u all--dis 1 is great." 

Lk 9:49	And Johnny answered n said, "Master, we saw someone expelling demons in yo name, n we tried 2 prevent him, cuz he doesn't follow in company w us."
Lk 9:50	But Jesus said 2 him, "Don’t prevent him, cuz whoever isn’t against u is 4 u." 

Lk 9:51	Now it happened dat when da days were approaching 4 him 2 be taken up, he set his face 2 go 2 Jerusalem.
Lk 9:52	And he sent messengers b4 him, n they went n entered into a village of da Samaritans in order 2 prepare 4 him.
Lk 9:53	And they didn't welcome him cuz he wuz determined 2 go 2 Jerusalem.
Lk 9:54	Now when da homeboys James n Johnny saw it, they said, "Lord, do u want us 2 call fire 2 come down from heaven n consume them?"
Lk 9:55	But he turned around n roasted them,
Lk 9:56	n they proceeded 2 anotha village. 

Lk 9:57	And as they were traveling on da road, someone said 2 him, "i’ll follow u wherever u go!"
Lk 9:58	And Jesus said 2 him, "Foxes hav dens n birbs of da sky hav nests, but da Son of Man haz no place 2 lay his head."
Lk 9:59	And he said 2 anotha, "Follow me!" But he said, "Lord, 1st allow me 2 go n bury my dad."
Lk 9:60	But he said 2 him, "Leave da ded 2 bury their own ded! But u go n proclaim da kingdom of God."
Lk 9:61	And anotha person also said, "i’ll follow u, Lord, but 1st allow me 2 say farewell 2 those in my house."
Lk 9:62	But Jesus said, "No 1 who puts his hand on da plow n looks back is fit 4 da kingdom of God!" 


CHAPTER 10
Lk 10:1	And after deez tingz, da Lord also appointed seventy-2 others n sent them out 2 by 2 b4 him into every town n place where he wuz 'bout 2 go.
Lk 10:2	And he said 2 them, "Da harvest is plentiful, but da workers r few. So ask da Lord of da harvest dat he send out workers into his harvest.
Lk 10:3	Go! Look, im sending u out like lambs in da midst of wolves!
Lk 10:4	Don’t carry a money bag or a traveler's bag or sandals, n greet nobody along da road.
Lk 10:5	And into whatever house u enter, 1st say, "Pce be 2 dis household!"
Lk 10:6	And if a son of pce is there, yo pce will rest on him. But if not, it’ll return 2 u.
Lk 10:7	And remain in da same house, eating n drinking whatever they provide, 4 da worker is worthy of his pay. Don’t move from house 2 house.
Lk 10:8	And into whatever town u enter n they welcome u, eat whatever is set b4 u,
Lk 10:9	n heal da sick in it, n tell them, "Da kingdom of God haz come near 2 u."
Lk 10:10	But into whatever town u enter n they don’t welcome u, go out into its streets n say,
Lk 10:11	"Even da dust of yo town dat clings 2 our feet we wipe off against u! Nevertheless kno dis: dat da kingdom of God haz come near!"
Lk 10:12	i tell u dat it gonna be more bearable on dat day 4 Sodom than 4 dat town! 

Lk 10:13	Damn u, Chorazin! Damn u, Bethsaida! Cuz if da miracles dat were done in u had been done in Tyre n Sidon, they’d hav repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth n ashes!
Lk 10:14	But it gonna be more bearable 4 Tyre n 4 Sidon in da judgment than 4 u!
Lk 10:15	And u, Capernaum, will u be exalted 2 heaven? No! U gonna be brought down 2 Hades!
Lk 10:16	Da 1 who listens 2 u listens 2 me, n da 1 who rejects u rejects me. But da 1 who rejects me rejects da 1 who sent me." 

Lk 10:17	And da seventy-2 returned w happiness, sayin’, "Lord, even da demons r subject 2 us in yo name!"
Lk 10:18	So he said 2 them, "i saw Satan falling like lightning from heaven.
Lk 10:19	Look, i’ve given u da authority 2 tread on sneks n scorpions, n over all da power of da enemy, n nothin’ will ever harm u.
Lk 10:20	Nevertheless, don’t rejoice in dis, dat da spirits r subject 2 u, but rejoice dat yo names r inscribed in heaven." 

Lk 10:21	At dat same time he rejoiced in da Holy Spirit n said, "i praise u, Dad, Lord of heaven n earth, dat u hav hidden deez tingz from da woke n smart n hav revealed them 2 yung kids. Yeah, Dad, 4 dis wuz pleasing b4 u.
Lk 10:22	All tingz hav been handed over 2 me by my Dad, n nobody knows who da Son is except da Dad n who da Dad is except da Son, n anyone 2 whom da Son wants 2 reveal him." 

Lk 10:23	And turning 2 da homeboys, he said privately, "Blessed r da eyes dat c da tingz which u c!
Lk 10:24	Cuz i tell u dat many prophets n kings desired 2 c da tingz which u c, n didn't c them, n 2 hear da tingz which u hear, n didn't hear them." 

Lk 10:25	And look, a certain legal expert stood up 2 test him, sayin’, "Teacher, wut must i do so dat i’ll inherit lyf 4ever?"
Lk 10:26	And he said 2 him, "Wut is written in da law? How do u read it?"
Lk 10:27	And he answered n said, "U will luv da Lord yo God from all yo heart, n w all yo soul, n w all yo strength, n w all yo mind, n yo bro as yoself."
Lk 10:28	And he said 2 him, "U hav answered correctly. Do dis n u will live." 

Lk 10:29	But he, wanting 2 justify himself, said 2 Jesus, "And who is my bro?"
Lk 10:30	And Jesus replied n said, "A certain man wuz goin’ down from Jerusalem 2 Jericho, n fell into da hands of robbers, who both stripped him n beat him. After inflicting blows on him, they went away, leaving him half ded.
Lk 10:31	Now by coincidence a certain priest wuz goin’ down on dat road, n when he saw him, he passed by on da opposite side.
Lk 10:32	And in da same wey also a Levite, when he came down 2 da place n saw him, passed by on da opposite side.
Lk 10:33	But a certain Samaritan who wuz traveling came up 2 him n, when he saw him, had compassion.
Lk 10:34	And he came up n bandaged his wounds, pouring on olive oil n wine, n he put him on his own animal n brought him 2 an inn n took care of him.
Lk 10:35	And on da next day, he took out 2 denarii n gave them 2 da innkeeper, n said, "Take care of him, n whatever u spend in addition, i’ll repay 2 u when i return.
Lk 10:36	Which of deez 3 do u suppose became a bro of da man who fell among da robbers?"
Lk 10:37	So he said, "Da 1 who showed mercy 2 him." And Jesus said 2 him, "U go n do like dat." 

Lk 10:38	Now as they traveled along, he entered into a certain village. And a certain woman named Martha welcomed him.
Lk 10:39	And she had a sister named Mary, who also sat at da feet of Jesus n wuz listening 2 his teaching.
Lk 10:40	But Martha wuz distracted w much preparation, so she approached n said, "Lord, is it not a concern 2 u dat my sister haz left me alone 2 make preparations? Then tell her dat she shud help me!"
Lk 10:41	But da Lord answered n said 2 her, "Martha, Martha, u r trippin’ n troubled 'bout many tingz!
Lk 10:42	But few tingz r necessary, or only 1 thang, 4 Mary haz chosen da better part, which won’t be taken away from her." 


CHAPTER 11
Lk 11:1	And it happened dat while he wuz in a certain place praying, when he stopped a certain 1 of his homies said 2 him, "Lord, teach us 2 pray, just like Johnny also taught his homies."
Lk 11:2	And he said 2 them, "When u pray, say, 
 "Dad, may yo name be treated as holy. May yo kingdom come.
Lk 11:3	Give us each day our daily bread.
Lk 11:4	And forgive us our sins, 4 we ourselves also forgive e’erybody who is indebted 2 us. And don’t lead us into temptation."

Lk 11:5	And he said 2 them, "Who of u will hav a friend, n will go 2 him at midnight n tell him, 'Friend, lend me 3 loaves,
Lk 11:6	cuz a friend of mine haz come 2 me on a journey, n i don’t hav anythin’ 2 set b4 him.'
Lk 11:7	And dat 1 will answer from inside n say, 'Don’t cause me trouble! Da door haz already been shut n my kids r w me in bed! i ain’t able 2 get up 2 give u anythin’.'
Lk 11:8	i tell u, even if he doesn't give him anythin’ after he gets up cuz he’s his friend, at any rate cuz of his impudence he’ll get up n give him whatever he needs. 

Lk 11:9	And i tell u, ask n it gonna be given 2 u; seek n u will find; knock n it gonna be opened 4 u.
Lk 11:10	Cuz e’erybody who asks receives, n da 1 who seeks finds, n 2 da 1 who knocks it gonna be opened.
Lk 11:11	But wut dad from among u, if his son will ask 4 a fish, instead of a fish will give him a snek?
Lk 11:12	Or also, if he’ll ask 4 an egg, will give him a scorpion?
Lk 11:13	So if u, even tho u r bad, kno how 2 give gud gifts 2 yo kids, how much more will da Dad from heaven give da Holy Spirit 2 those who ask him?" 

Lk 11:14	And he wuz expelling a mute demon. Now it happened dat when da demon came out, da man who had been mute spoke, n da crowds were shook.
Lk 11:15	But some of them said, "By Beelzebul da ruler of demons he expels demons!"
Lk 11:16	And others, in order 2 test him, were demanding from him a sign from heaven.
Lk 11:17	But he, knowing their thoughts, said 2 them, "Every kingdom divided against itself is laid waste, n a divided household falls.
Lk 11:18	So if Satan also is divided against himself, how’ll his kingdom stand? Cuz u say dat i expel demons by Beelzebul.
Lk 11:19	But if i expel demons by Beelzebul, by whom do yo sons expel them? Cuz of dis reason they gonna be yo judges!
Lk 11:20	But if i expel demons by da finger of God, then da kingdom of God haz come on u!
Lk 11:21	When a strong man, fully armed, guards his own palace, his possessions r safe.
Lk 11:22	But when a stronger man attacs him n conquers him, he takes away his full armor in which he trusted n distributes his plunder.
Lk 11:23	Da 1 who isn’t w me is against me, n da 1 who doesn't gather w me scatters. 

Lk 11:24	"Whenever an dirty spirit haz gone out of a person, it travels thru waterless places searching 4 rest, n doesn't find it. It says, 'i’ll return 2 my house from which i came out.'
Lk 11:25	And when it arrives it finds da house swept n put in order.
Lk 11:26	Then it goes n brings along 7 other spirits more bad than itself, n they go in n live there. And da last state of dat person becomes worse than da 1st!" 

Lk 11:27	Now it happened dat as he said deez tingz, a certain woman from da crowd raised her voice n said 2 him, "Blessed is da womb dat bore u, n da breasts at which u nursed!"
Lk 11:28	But he said, "On da contrary, blessed r those who hear da word of God n follow it!" 

Lk 11:29	And as da crowds were increasing, he began 2 say, "Dis generation is an bad generation! It demands a sign, n no sign gonna be given 2 it except da sign of Jonah!
Lk 11:30	Cuz just like Jonah became a sign 2 da Ninevites, so also da Son of Man gonna be 2 dis generation.
Lk 11:31	Da queen of da south will rise up at da judgment w da ppl of dis generation n condemn them, cuz she came from da ends of da earth 2 hear da wisdom of Solomon, n look, somethin’ better than Solomon is here!
Lk 11:32	Da ppl of Nineveh will stand up at da judgment w dis generation n condemn it, cuz they repented at da proclamation of Jonah, n look, somethin’ better than Jonah is here! 

Lk 11:33	"No 1 after lighting a lamp puts it in a cellar or under a bushel basket, but on a lampstand, so dat those who come in can c da light.
Lk 11:34	Yo eye is da lamp of da body. When yo eye is sincere, yo whole body is full of light also. But when it’s bad, yo body is dark also.
Lk 11:35	So pay careful attention dat da light in u isn’t darkness!
Lk 11:36	If so yo whole body is full of light, not having any part dark, it gonna be totally full of light, as when da lamp w its light gives light 2 u." 

Lk 11:37	And as he wuz talkin’, a Pharisee asked him 2 hav a meal w him, n he went in n reclined at table.
Lk 11:38	And da Pharisee, when he saw it, wuz shook dat he didn't 1st wash b4 da meal.
Lk 11:39	But da Lord said 2 him, "Now u Pharisees cleanse da outside of da cup n of da dish, but yo inside is full of greediness n wickedness.
Lk 11:40	Fools! Did not da 1 who made da outside make da inside also?
Lk 11:41	But give as charitable giving da tingz dat r within, n look, everythin’ is clean 4 u. 

Lk 11:42	"But damn u, Pharisees, cuz u pay a 10th of mint n rue n every garden herb, n neglect justice n luv 4 God! But 'twas necessary 2 do deez tingz without neglecting those tingz also.
Lk 11:43	Damn u, Pharisees, cuz u luv da best seat in da synagogues n da greetings in da marketplaces!
Lk 11:44	Damn u, cuz u r like unmarked graves, n da ppl who walk over them dunno it! 

Lk 11:45	And 1 of da legal experts answered n said 2 him, "Teacher, when u say deez tingz, u roast us also!"
Lk 11:46	So he said, "Damn u also, legal experts, cuz u load ppl w burdens hard 2 bear, n u yoselves don’t touch da burdens w 1 of yo fingers!
Lk 11:47	Damn u, cuz u build da tombs of da prophets, n yo dads killed them!
Lk 11:48	As a result u r witnesses, n u approve of da deeds of yo dads, cuz they killed them n u build their tombs!
Lk 11:49	Cuz of dis reason also da wisdom of God said, 'i’ll send 2 them prophets n apostles, n some of them they’ll kill n persecute,'
Lk 11:50	so dat da blood of all da prophets dat’s been shed from da foundation of da world may be required of dis generation,
Lk 11:51	from da blood of Abel 2 da blood of Zechariah, who died between da altar n da temple building. Yeah, i tell u, it gonna be required of dis generation!
Lk 11:52	Damn u, legal experts, cuz u hav taken away da key 2 knowledge! U didn't enter yoselves, n u hindered those who were entering!" 

Lk 11:53	And when he departed from there, da scribes n da Pharisees began 2 be terribly hostile, n 2 question him closely 'bout many tingz,
Lk 11:54	plotting 2 catch him w reference 2 somethin’ he might say. 


CHAPTER 12
Lk 12:1	During dis time when a crowd of many thousands had gathered together, so dat they were trampling 1 anotha, he began 2 tell his homeboys 1st, "Beware 4 yoselves of da leaven of da Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.
Lk 12:2	But nothin’ is concealed dat’ll not be revealed, n secret dat’ll not be made known.
Lk 12:3	So everythin’ dat u hav said in da dark gonna be heard in da light, n wut u hav whispered in da inner rooms gonna be proclaimed on da housetops. 

Lk 12:4	"And i tell u, my friends, don’t be afraid of those who kill da body, n after deez tingz don’t hav anythin’ more 2 do.
Lk 12:5	But i’ll show u whom u shud fear: fear da 1 who haz authority, after da killing, 2 yeet u into hell! Yeah, i tell u, fear dis 1!
Lk 12:6	R not 5 sparrows sold 4 2 pennies? And not 1 of them is forgotten in da sight of God.
Lk 12:7	But even da hairs of yo head r all numbered! Don’t be afraid; u r worth more than many sparrows. 

Lk 12:8	"And i tell u, e’erybody who acknowledges me b4 ppl, da Son of Man also will acknowledge him b4 da angels of God,
Lk 12:9	but da 1 who denies me b4 ppl gonna be denied b4 da angels of God.
Lk 12:10	And e’erybody who speaks a word against da Son of Man, it gonna be forgiven him, but 2 da 1 who blasphemes against da Holy Spirit, it’ll not be forgiven.
Lk 12:11	But when they bring u b4 da synagogues n da rulers n da authorities, don’t be trippin’ how or wut u shud talk in yo own defense or wut u shud say,
Lk 12:12	4 da Holy Spirit will teach u in dat same hr wut it’s necessary 2 say." 

Lk 12:13	Now someone from da crowd said 2 him, "Teacher, tell my bro 2 divide da inheritance w me!"
Lk 12:14	But he said 2 him, "Man, who made me a judge or an arbitrator over u?"
Lk 12:15	And he said 2 them, "Watch out n guard yoselves from all greediness, cuz not even when someone’s an abundance does his lyf consist of his possessions."
Lk 12:16	And he told a parable 2 them, sayin’, "Da land of a certain rich man yielded an abundant harvest.
Lk 12:17	And he reasoned 2 himself, sayin’, 'Wut shud i do? Cuz i don’t hav anywhere i can gather in my crops.'
Lk 12:18	And he said, 'i’ll do dis: i’ll tear down my barns n build larger ones, n i’ll gather in there all my grain n possessions.
Lk 12:19	And i’ll tell my soul, "Soul, u hav many possessions stored up 4 many yrs. Chill, eat, drink, celebrate!" '
Lk 12:20	But God said 2 him, 'Fool! Dis night yo lyf is demanded from u, n da tingz which u hav prepared--whose will they be?'
Lk 12:21	So is da 1 who stores up treasure 4 himself, n who isn’t rich toward God!" 

Lk 12:22	And he said 2 his homies, "Cuz of dis reason i tell u, don’t be trippin’ 4 yo lyf, wut u will eat, or 4 yo body, wut u will wear.
Lk 12:23	Cuz lyf is more than food, n da body more than clothing.
Lk 12:24	Consider da ravens, dat they neither sow nor reap; 2 them there’s neither storeroom nor barn, n God feeds them. How much more r u worth than da birbs?
Lk 12:25	And which of u by bein’ trippin’ is able 2 add an hr 2 his lyf span?
Lk 12:26	If then u aren’t even able 2 do a very lil’ thang, y r u trippin’ 'bout da rest?
Lk 12:27	Consider da lilies, how they grow: they don’t toil or spin, but i tell u, not even Solomon in all his glory wuz dressed like 1 of deez.
Lk 12:28	But if God clothes da grass in da field in dis wey, even tho it’s here 2day n tmr is yeeted into da oven, how much more will he do so 4 u, u of lil’ faith?
Lk 12:29	And u, don’t consider wut u will eat n wut u will drink, n don’t be trippin’.
Lk 12:30	Cuz all da nations of da world seek after deez tingz, n yo Dad knows dat u need deez tingz.
Lk 12:31	But seek his kingdom n deez tingz gonna be added 2 u. 

Lk 12:32	"Don’t be afraid, lil’ flock, cuz yo Dad is well pleased 2 give u da kingdom.
Lk 12:33	Sell yo possessions n give charitable gifts. Make 4 yoselves money bags dat don’t wear out, an inexhaustible treasure in heaven where thief doesn't approach or moth destroy.
Lk 12:34	Cuz where yo treasure is, there yo heart gonna be also. 

Lk 12:35	"U gotta be prepared 4 action n yo lamps burning.
Lk 12:36	And u, be like ppl who r waiting 4 their master when he returns from da wedding feast, so dat when he comes back n knocks, they can open da door 4 him immediately.
Lk 12:37	Blessed r those slaves whom da master will find on da alert when he returns! TBH he’ll dress himself 4 service n hav them recline at da table n will come by n serve them.
Lk 12:38	Even if he shud come back in da 2nd or in da 3rd watch of da night n find them like dis, blessed r they!
Lk 12:39	But understand dis, dat if da master of da house had known wut hr da thief wuz comin’, he’d not hav left his house 2 be broken into.
Lk 12:40	U also gotta be ready, cuz da Son of Man is comin’ at an hr dat u don’t think he’ll come." 

Lk 12:41	And Pete said, "Lord, r u telling dis parable 4 us, or also 4 e’erybody?"
Lk 12:42	And da Lord said, "Who then is da faithful woke manager whom da master will put in charge over his servants 2 give them their food allowance at da right time?
Lk 12:43	Blessed is dat slave whom his master will find so doin’ when he comes back.
Lk 12:44	TBH he’ll put him in charge of all his possessions.
Lk 12:45	But if dat slave shud tell himself, 'My master is taking a long time 2 return,' n he begins 2 beat da male slaves n da female slaves n 2 eat n drink n get drunk,
Lk 12:46	da master of dat slave will come on a day dat he doesn't expect n at an hr dat he doesn't kno, n will cut him in 2 n assign his place w da unbelievers.
Lk 12:47	And dat slave who knew da will of his master n didn't prepare or do accordin’ 2 wut he wants gonna be given a severe beating.
Lk 12:48	But da 1 who didn't kno n did tingz deserving blows gonna be given a light beating. And from e’erybody 2 whom much haz been given, much gonna be demanded, n from him 2 whom they entrusted much, they’ll ask him cuz even more. 

Lk 12:49	"i’ve come 2 bring fire on da earth, n how i wish dat it had been kindled already!
Lk 12:50	But i’ve a baptism 2 be baptized w, n how im distressed until it’s accomplished!
Lk 12:51	Do u think dat i’ve come 2 grant pce on da earth? No, i tell u, but rather division!
Lk 12:52	Cuz from now on there gonna be 5 in 1 household, divided 3 against 2 n 2 against 3.
Lk 12:53	They gonna be divided, dad against son n son against dad, mom against daughter n daughter against mom, mom-in-law against her daughter-in-law n daughter-in-law against mom-in-law." 

Lk 12:54	And he also said 2 da crowds, "When u c a cloud comin’ up in da west, u say at once, 'A rainstorm is comin’,' n so it happens.
Lk 12:55	And when u c da south wind blowing, u say, 'There gonna be burning heat,' n it happens.
Lk 12:56	Hypocrites! U kno how 2 evaluate da appearance of da earth n da sky, but how’s it u dunno how 2 evaluate dis present time? 

Lk 12:57	And y do u not also judge 4 yoselves wut is right?
Lk 12:58	Cuz as u r goin’ w yo accuser b4 da magistrate, make an effort 2 come 2 a settlement w him on da wey, so dat he’ll not drag u 2 da judge, n da judge will hand u over 2 da bailiff, n da bailiff will yeet u into prison.
Lk 12:59	i tell u, u will never get out of there until u hav paid back even da last cent!" 


CHAPTER 13
Lk 13:1	Now at da same time some had come 2 tell him 'bout da Galileans whose blood Pilate had mixed w their sacrifices.
Lk 13:2	And he answered n said 2 them, "Do u think dat deez Galileans were sinners worse than all da Galileans, cuz they suffered deez tingz?
Lk 13:3	No, i tell u, but unless u repent u will all die as well!
Lk 13:4	Or those 18 on whom da tower in Siloam fell n killed them--do u think dat they were sinners worse than all da ppl who live in Jerusalem?
Lk 13:5	No, i tell u, but unless u repent, u will all die as well!" 

Lk 13:6	And he told dis parable: "A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard, n he came looking 4 fruit on it n didn't find any.
Lk 13:7	So he said 2 da gardener, 'Look, 4 3 yrs i’ve come looking 4 fruit on dis fig tree n didn't find any. Cut it down! Y shud it even exhaust da soil?'
Lk 13:8	But he answered n said 2 him, 'Sir, leave it alone dis yr also, until i dig around it n put manure on it.
Lk 13:9	And if indeed it produces fruit in da comin’ yr, so much da better, but if not, u can cut it down.'" 

Lk 13:10	Now he wuz teaching in 1 of da synagogues on da Sabbath.
Lk 13:11	And look, a woman wuz there who had a spirit dat had disabled her 4 18 yrs, n she wuz bent over n not able 2 straighten herself up totally.
Lk 13:12	And when he saw her, Jesus summoned her n said 2 her, "Woman, u r freed from yo disability!"
Lk 13:13	And he placed his hands on her, n immediately she straightened up n glorified God.
Lk 13:14	But da ruler of da synagogue, indignant cuz Jesus had healed on da Sabbath, answered n said 2 da crowd, "There r 6 days on which it’s necessary 2 work. So come n be healed on them, n not on da day of da Sabbath!"
Lk 13:15	But da Lord answered n said 2 him, "Hypocrites! Does not each 1 of u untie his ox or his donkey from da feeding trough on da Sabbath n lead it away 2 water it?
Lk 13:16	And dis woman, who is a daughter of Abe, whom Satan bound 18 long yrs--is it not necessary dat she be released from dis bond on da day of da Sabbath?"
Lk 13:17	And when he said deez tingz, all those who opposed him were humiliated, n da whole crowd wuz rejoicing at all da splendid tingz dat were bein’ done by him. 

Lk 13:18	So he said, "Wut is da kingdom of God like, n 2 wut will i compare it?
Lk 13:19	It’s like a mustard seed dat a man took n sowed in his own garden, n it grew n became a tree, n da birbs of da sky nested in its branches." 

Lk 13:20	And again he said, "2 wut will i compare da kingdom of God?
Lk 13:21	It’s like yeast dat a woman took n hid in 3 measures of wheat flour until da whole batch wuz leavened." 

Lk 13:22	And he wuz goin’ throughout towns n villages, teaching n making his journey toward Jerusalem.
Lk 13:23	And someone said 2 him, "Lord, r there only a few who r saved?" And he said 2 them,
Lk 13:24	"Make every effort 2 enter thru da narrow door, cuz many, i tell u, will seek 2 enter n won’t be able 2,
Lk 13:25	when once da master of da house haz gotten up n shut da door, n u begin 2 stand outside n knock on da door, sayin’, 'Lord, open da door 4 us!' And he’ll answer n tell u, 'idk where u r from!'
Lk 13:26	Then u will begin 2 say, 'We ate n drank in yo presence, n u taught in our streets!'
Lk 13:27	And he’ll reply, sayin’ 2 u, 'idk where u r from! Go away from me, all u evildoers!'
Lk 13:28	In dat place there gonna be weepin’ n gnashing of teeth, when u c Abe n Isaac n Jake n all da prophets in da kingdom of God, but yoselves yeeted outside!
Lk 13:29	And they’ll come from east n west, n from north n south, n will recline at da table in da kingdom of God.
Lk 13:30	And look, some r last who gonna be 1st, n some r 1st who gonna be last." 

Lk 13:31	At dat same hr some Pharisees came up n said 2 him, "Go out n depart from here, cuz Herod wants 2 kill u!"
Lk 13:32	And he said 2 them, "Go n tell dat fox, 'Look, im expelling demons n performing healings 2day n tmr, n on da 3rd day i’ll complete my work.'
Lk 13:33	Nevertheless, it’s necessary 4 me 2 be on da wey 2day n tmr n on da next day, cuz it isn’t possible 4 a prophet 2 die outside Jerusalem. 

Lk 13:34	"Jerusalem, Jerusalem, da 1 who kills da prophets n stones those who r sent 2 her! How many times i wanted 2 gather yo kids together da wey a hen gathers her own brood under her wings, n u weren't willing!
Lk 13:35	Look, yo house haz been left 2 u! And i tell u, u will never c me until da time will come when u say, 'Blessed is da 1 who comes in da name of da Lord!'" 


CHAPTER 14
Lk 14:1	And it happened dat when he came 2 da house of a certain 1 of da leaders of da Pharisees on a Sabbath 2 eat a meal, they were watching him closely.
Lk 14:2	And look, a certain man wuz in front of him, suffering from edema.
Lk 14:3	And Jesus answered n said 2 da legal experts n Pharisees, sayin’, "Is it permitted 2 heal on da Sabbath, or not?"
Lk 14:4	But they remained silent. And he took hold of him n healed him, n sent him away.
Lk 14:5	And he said 2 them, "Who among u, if yo son or yo ox falls into a well on da day of da Sabbath, won’t immediately pull him out?"
Lk 14:6	And they weren't able 2 make a reply 2 deez tingz. 

Lk 14:7	Now he told a parable 2 those who had been invited when he noticed how they were choosing 4 themselves da places of honor, sayin’ 2 them,
Lk 14:8	"When u r invited by someone 2 a wedding feast, don’t recline at da table in da place of honor, lest someone more distinguished than u haz been invited by him,
Lk 14:9	n da 1 who invited u both will come n tell u, 'Give da place 2 dis person,' n then w shame u will begin 2 take da last place.
Lk 14:10	But when u r invited, go n recline at da table in da last place, so dat when da 1 who invited u comes, he’ll tell u, 'Friend, move up higher.' Then it gonna be an honor 2 u in da presence of all those who r reclining at da table w u.
Lk 14:11	Cuz e’erybody who exalts himself gonna be humbled, n da 1 who humbles himself gonna be exalted." 

Lk 14:12	And he also said 2 da 1 who had invited him, "When u give a dinner or a banquet, don’t invite yo friends or yo bros or yo relatives or wealthy bros, lest they also invite u in return, n repayment come 2 u.
Lk 14:13	But whenever u give a banquet, invite da poor, da crippled, da lame, da blind,
Lk 14:14	n u gonna be blessed, cuz they aren’t able 2 repay u. Cuz it gonna be paid back 2 u at da resurrection of da gud." 

Lk 14:15	Now when 1 of those reclining at da table w him heard deez tingz, he said 2 him, "Blessed is e’erybody who will eat bread in da kingdom of God!"
Lk 14:16	But he said 2 him, "A certain man wuz giving a large banquet n invited many.
Lk 14:17	And he sent his slave at da hr of da banquet 2 tell those who hav been invited, 'Come, cuz now it’s ready!'
Lk 14:18	And they all alike began 2 excuse themselves. Da 1st said 2 him, 'i’ve purchased a field, n i must go out 2 look at it. i ask u, consider me excused.'
Lk 14:19	And anotha said, 'i’ve purchased 5 yoke of oxen, n im goin’ 2 examine them. i ask u, consider me excused.'
Lk 14:20	And anotha said, 'i’ve married a wife, n 4 dis reason i ain’t able 2 come.'
Lk 14:21	And da slave came n reported deez tingz 2 his master. Then da master of da house became angry n said 2 his slave, 'Go out quickly into da streets n alleys of da city n bring in here da poor n crippled n blind n lame!'
Lk 14:22	And da slave said, 'Sir, wut u ordered haz been done, n there’s still room.'
Lk 14:23	And da master said 2 da slave, 'Go out into da highways n hedges n press them 2 come in, so dat my house gonna be filled!
Lk 14:24	Cuz i tell u dat none of those persons who were invited will taste my banquet!'" 

Lk 14:25	Now large crowds were goin’ along w him, n he turned around n said 2 them,
Lk 14:26	"If anyone comes 2 me n doesn't h8 his own dad n mom n wife n kids n bros n sisters, n furthermore, even his own lyf, he can’t be my homeboy.
Lk 14:27	Whoever doesn't carry his own cross n follow me can’t be my homie.
Lk 14:28	Cuz which of u, wanting 2 build a tower, doesn't 1st sit down n calculate da cost 2 c if he’s enough 2 complete it?
Lk 14:29	Otherwise after he’s laid da foundation n isn’t able 2 finish it, all who c it’ll begin 2 ridicule him,
Lk 14:30	sayin’, 'Dis man began 2 build n wasn’t able 2 finish!'
Lk 14:31	Or wut king, goin’ out 2 engage anotha king in battle, doesn't sit down 1st n deliberate whether he’s able w 10 K 2 oppose da 1 comin’ against him w 20 K.
Lk 14:32	But if not, while da other is still far away, he sends an ambassador n asks 4 terms of pce.
Lk 14:33	In da same wae, so, every 1 of u who doesn't renounce all his own possessions can’t be my homeboy. 

Lk 14:34	"Now salt is gud, but if salt becomes tasteless, w wut will it be made salty?
Lk 14:35	It’s usable neither 4 da soil nor 4 da manure pile; they yeet it out. Da 1 who haz ears 2 hear, let him hear!" 


CHAPTER 15
Lk 15:1	Now all da tax collectors n da sinners were drawing near 2 hear him.
Lk 15:2	And both da Pharisees n da scribes were complaining, sayin’, "Dis man welcomes sinners n eats w them!" 

Lk 15:3	So he told them dis parable, sayin’,
Lk 15:4	"Wut man of u, having a hundred sheep n losing 1 of them, doesn't leave da 99 in da grassland n go after da 1 dat wuz lost until he finds it?
Lk 15:5	And when he’s found it, he places it on his shoulders, rejoicing.
Lk 15:6	And when he returns 2 his home, he calls together his friends n bros, sayin’ 2 them, 'Rejoice w me, cuz i’ve found my sheep dat wuz lost!'
Lk 15:7	i tell u dat in da same wey, there gonna be more happiness in heaven over 1 sinner who repents than over 99 gud ppl who hav no need of repentance. 

Lk 15:8	Or wut woman who haz 10 drachmas, if she loses 1 drachma, doesn't light a lamp n sweep da house n search carefully until she finds it?
Lk 15:9	And when she’s found it, she calls together her friends n bros, sayin’, 'Rejoice w me, cuz i’ve found da drachma dat i had lost!'
Lk 15:10	In da same wey, i tell u, there’s happiness in da presence of da angels of God over 1 sinner who repents." 

Lk 15:11	And he said, "A certain man had 2 sons.
Lk 15:12	And da younger of them said 2 his dad, 'Dad, gimme da share of da property dat’s comin’ 2 me.' So he divided his assets between them.
Lk 15:13	And after not many days, da younger son gathered everythin’ n went on a journey 2 a distant country, n there he squandered his wealth by livin’ wastefully.
Lk 15:14	And after he had spent everythin’, there wuz a severe famine throughout dat country, n he began 2 be in need.
Lk 15:15	And he went n hired himself out 2 1 of da citizens of dat country, n he sent him into his fields 2 tend pigs.
Lk 15:16	And he wuz longing 2 fill his stomach w da carob pods dat da pigs were eating, n nobody wuz giving anythin’ 2 him. 

Lk 15:17	"But when he came 2 himself, he said, 'How many of my dad's hired workers hav an abundance of food, n im dying here from hunger!
Lk 15:18	i’ll set out n go 2 my dad n will tell him, 'Dad, i’ve sinned against heaven n in yo sight!
Lk 15:19	im no longer worthy 2 be called yo son! Make me like 1 of yo hired workers.'
Lk 15:20	And he set out n came 2 his own dad. But while he wuz still a long wae away, his dad saw him n had compassion, n ran n embraced him n kissed him.
Lk 15:21	And his son said 2 him, 'Dad, i’ve sinned against heaven n in yo sight! im no longer worthy 2 be called yo son!'
Lk 15:22	But his dad said 2 his slaves, 'Quickly bring out da best robe n put it on him, n put a ring on his finger n sandals on his feet!
Lk 15:23	And bring da fattened calf--kill it n let’s eat n celebrate,
Lk 15:24	cuz dis son of mine wuz ded, n is alive again! He wuz lost n is found!' And they began 2 celebrate. 

Lk 15:25	"Now his older son wuz in da field, n when he came n approached da house, he heard music n dancing.
Lk 15:26	And he summoned 1 of da slaves n asked wut deez tingz meant.
Lk 15:27	And he said 2 him, 'Yo bro haz come, n yo dad haz killed da fattened calf cuz he’s gotten him back healthy.'
Lk 15:28	But he became angry n didn't wanna go in. So his dad came out n began 2 beg him.
Lk 15:29	But he answered n said 2 his dad, 'Look, so many yrs i’ve served u, n hav never disobeyed yo command! And u never gave me a yung goat so dat i could celebrate w my friends!
Lk 15:30	But when dis son of urs returned--who haz consumed yo assets w hoes--u killed da fattened calf 4 him!'
Lk 15:31	But he said 2 him, 'Kid, u r always w me, n everythin’ i’ve belongs 2 u.
Lk 15:32	But 'twas necessary 2 celebrate n 2 rejoice, cuz dis bro of urs wuz ded, n is alive, n wuz lost, n is found!'" 


CHAPTER 16
Lk 16:1	And he also said 2 da homeboys, "A certain man wuz rich, who had a manager. And charges were brought 2 him dat dis person wuz squandering his possessions.
Lk 16:2	And he summoned him n said 2 him, 'Wut is dis i hear 'bout u? Give da account of yo management, cuz u can no longer manage.'
Lk 16:3	And da manager said 2 himself, 'Wut shud i do, cuz my master is taking away da management from me? i ain’t strong enough 2 dig; im ashamed 2 beg.
Lk 16:4	i kno wut i shud do, so dat when im removed from da management they’ll welcome me into their homes!'
Lk 16:5	And he summoned each 1 of his own master's debtors n said 2 da 1st, 'How much do u owe my master?'
Lk 16:6	And he said, 'A hundred measures of olive oil.' So he said 2 him, 'Take yo promissory note n sit down quickly n write fifty.'
Lk 16:7	Then he said 2 anotha, 'And how much do u owe?' And he said, 'A hundred measures of wheat.' He said 2 him, 'Take yo promissory note n write eighty.'
Lk 16:8	And da master praised da dishonest manager, cuz he had acted shrewdly. Cuz da sons of dis age r shrewder than da sons of light w regard 2 their own generation.
Lk 16:9	And i tell u, make friends 4 yoselves by means of unrighteous wealth, so dat when it runs out they’ll welcome u into da eternal dwellings. 

Lk 16:10	"Da 1 who is faithful in lil af’ is also faithful in much, n da 1 who is dishonest in lil af’ is also dishonest in much.
Lk 16:11	If then u haven't been faithful w unrighteous wealth, who will entrust 2 u da tru riches?
Lk 16:12	And if u haven't been faithful w wut belongs 2 anotha, who will give u yo own?
Lk 16:13	No domestic slave is able 2 serve 2 masters, 4 either he’ll h8 da 1 n luv da other, or he gonna be devoted 2 1 n will h8 da other. U aren’t able 2 serve God n money." 

Lk 16:14	Now da Pharisees, who were lovers of money, heard all deez tingz, n they made fun of him.
Lk 16:15	And he said 2 them, "U r da ones who justify themselves in da sight of men, but God knows yo hearts! Cuz wut is considered exalted among men is an abomination in da sight of God. 

Lk 16:16	"Da law n da prophets were until Johnny; from dat time on da kingdom of God haz been proclaimed, n e’erybody is urgently pressed into it.
Lk 16:17	But it’s easier 4 heaven n earth 2 pass away than 4 1 stroke of a letter of da law 2 become invalid. 

Lk 16:18	"E’erybody who divorces his wife n marries anotha cheats, n da 1 who marries a woman divorced from her husband cheats. 

Lk 16:19	"Now a certain man wuz rich, n dressed in purple cloth n fine linen, feasting sumptuously every day.
Lk 16:20	And a certain poor man named Lazarus, covered w sores, lay at his gate,
Lk 16:21	n wuz longing 2 be filled w wut fell from da table of da rich man. But even da doggos came n licked his sores.
Lk 16:22	Now it happened dat da poor man died, n he wuz carried away by da angels 2 Abe's side. And da rich man also died n wuz buried.
Lk 16:23	And in Hades he lifted up his eyes as he wuz in torment n saw Abe from a distance, n Lazarus at his side.
Lk 16:24	And he called out n said, 'Dad Abe, hav mercy on me, n send Lazarus so dat he could dip da tip of his finger in water n cool my tongue, cuz im suffering pain in dis flame!'
Lk 16:25	But Abe said, 'Kid, remember dat u received yo gud tingz during yo lyf, n Lazarus like dat bad tingz. But now he’s comforted here, but u r suffering pain.
Lk 16:26	And in addition 2 all deez tingz, a great chasm haz been established between us n u, so dat those who wanna cross over from here 2 u aren’t able 2 do so, nor can they cross over from there 2 us.'
Lk 16:27	So he said, 'Then i ask u, dad, dat u send him 2 my dad's house,
Lk 16:28	cuz i’ve 5 bros, so dat he could warn them, so dat they also shouldn’t come 2 dis place of torment!'
Lk 16:29	But Abe said, 'They hav Moe n da prophets; they must listen 2 them.'
Lk 16:30	And he said, 'No, dad Abe, but if someone from da ded goes 2 them, they’ll repent!'
Lk 16:31	But he said 2 him, 'If they don’t listen 2 Moe n da prophets, neither will they be convinced if someone rises from da ded.'" 


CHAPTER 17
Lk 17:1	And he said 2 his homeboys, "It’s impossible 4 causes 4 stumbling not 2 come, but woe 2 him thru whom they come!
Lk 17:2	It would be better 4 him if a millstone is placed around his neck n he’s yeeted into da sea than dat he causes 1 of deez lil’ ones 2 sin. 

Lk 17:3	"Be concerned 'bout yoselves! If yo bro sins, roast him, n if he repents, forgive him.
Lk 17:4	And if he sins against u 7 times in a day, n 7 times he returns 2 u sayin’, 'i repent,' u must forgive him." 

Lk 17:5	And da apostles said 2 da Lord, "Increase our faith!"
Lk 17:6	So da Lord said, "If u hav faith like a mustard seed, u could tell dis mulberry tree, 'Be uprooted n planted in da sea,' n it’d obey u. 

Lk 17:7	"And which of u who haz a slave plowing or shepherding sheep who comes in from da field will tell him, 'Come here at once n recline at da table'?
Lk 17:8	Will he not rather tell him, 'Prepare somethin’ dat i may eat, n dress yoself 2 serve me while i eat n drink, n after deez tingz u will eat n drink.'
Lk 17:9	He won’t be grateful 2 da slave cuz he did wut wuz ordered, will he?
Lk 17:10	So u also, when u hav done all da tingz u were ordered 2 do, say, 'We r unworthy slaves; we've done wut we were obligated 2 do.'" 

Lk 17:11	And it happened dat while traveling toward Jerusalem, he wuz passing thru da region between Samaria n Galilee.
Lk 17:12	And as he wuz entering into a certain village, 10 men met him--lepers, who stood at a distance.
Lk 17:13	And they raised their voices, sayin’, "Jesus, Master, hav mercy on us!"
Lk 17:14	And when he saw them he said 2 them, "Go n show yoselves 2 da priests." And it happened dat as they were goin’, they were cleansed.
Lk 17:15	But 1 of them, when he saw dat he wuz healed, turned back, praising God w a loud voice.
Lk 17:16	And he fell on his face at his feet, giving thanks 2 him. And he wuz a Samaritan.
Lk 17:17	So Jesus answered n said, "Were not 10 cleansed? And where r da 9?
Lk 17:18	Wuz nobody found 2 turn back n give praise 2 God except dis foreigner?"
Lk 17:19	And he said 2 him, "Get up n go yo wey. Yo faith haz saved u." 

Lk 17:20	Now when he wuz asked by da Pharisees when da kingdom of God would come, he answered them n said, "Da kingdom of God doesn't come w tingz dat can be observed,
Lk 17:21	nor will they say, 'Look, here it’s!' or 'There!' Cuz look, da kingdom of God is in yo midst." 

Lk 17:22	And he said 2 da homeboys, "Days will come when u will desire 2 c 1 of da days of da Son of Man, n u won’t c it.
Lk 17:23	And they’ll tell u, 'Look, there!' 'Look, here!' Don’t go out or run after them!
Lk 17:24	Cuz just like da lightning shines forth, flashing from 1 place under heaven 2 anotha place under heaven, so da Son of Man gonna be in his day.
Lk 17:25	But 1st it’s necessary 4 him 2 suffer many tingz, n 2 be rejected by dis generation.
Lk 17:26	And just like 'twas in da days of Noah, so also it gonna be in da days of da Son of Man--
Lk 17:27	they were eating, they were drinking, they were marrying, they were bein’ given in marriage, until da day Noah entered into da ark, n da flood came n destroyed them all.
Lk 17:28	Likewise, just like 'twas in da days of Lot--they were eating, they were drinking, they were buying, they were selling, they were planting, they were building.
Lk 17:29	But on da day dat Lot went out from Sodom, it rained fire n sulphur from heaven n destroyed them all.
Lk 17:30	It gonna be just da same on da day dat da Son of Man is revealed.
Lk 17:31	On dat day, whoever is on da housetop n his goods r in da house must not come down 2 take them away. And like dat da 1 who is in da field must not turn back
Lk 17:32	Remember Lot's wife!
Lk 17:33	Whoever seeks 2 preserve his lyf will lose it, but whoever loses it’ll keep it.
Lk 17:34	i tell u dat in dat night there gonna be 2 in 1 bed; 1 gonna be taken n da other gonna be left.
Lk 17:35	There gonna be 2 women grinding at da same place; 1 gonna be taken n da other gonna be left." 

Lk 17:37	And they answered n said 2 him, "Where, Lord?" So he said 2 them, "Where da ded body is, there also da vultures gonna be gathered." 


CHAPTER 18
Lk 18:1	And he told them a parable 2 show dat they must always pray n not be discouraged,
Lk 18:2	sayin’, "There wuz a certain judge in a certain town who didn't fear God n didn't respeck ppl.
Lk 18:3	And there wuz a widow in dat town, n she kept comin’ 2 him, sayin’, 'Grant me justice against my adversary!'
Lk 18:4	And he wasn’t willing 4 a time, but after deez tingz he said 2 himself, 'Even if i don’t fear God or respeck ppl,
Lk 18:5	yet cuz dis widow is causing trouble 4 me, i’ll grant her justice, so dat she doesn't wear me down in da end by her comin’ back!'"
Lk 18:6	And da Lord said, "Listen 2 wut da unrighteous judge is sayin’!
Lk 18:7	And won’t God ofc c 2 it dat justice is done 2 his chosen ones who cri out 2 him day n night, n will he delay toward them?
Lk 18:8	i tell u dat he’ll c 2 it dat justice is done 4 them soon! Nevertheless, when da Son of Man comes, then will he find faith on earth?" 

Lk 18:9	And he also told dis parable 2 some who trusted in themselves dat they were gud, n looked down on e’erybody else:
Lk 18:10	"2 men went up 2 da temple 2 pray, 1 a Pharisee n da other a tax collector.
Lk 18:11	Da Pharisee stood n prayed deez tingz w reference 2 himself: 'God, i give thanks 2 u dat i ain’t like other ppl--swindlers, unrighteous ppl, cheaters, or even like dis tax collector!
Lk 18:12	i fast twice a week; i give a 10th of all dat i get.'
Lk 18:13	But da tax collector, standing far away, didn't want even 2 raise his eyes 2 heaven, but wuz beating his breast, sayin’, 'God, be merciful 2 me, a sinner!'
Lk 18:14	i tell u, dis man went down 2 his house justified rather than dat 1! Cuz e’erybody who exalts himself gonna be humbled, but da 1 who humbles himself gonna be exalted." 

Lk 18:15	Now they were bringing even their babies 2 him so dat he could touch them. But when da homeboys saw it, they roasted them.
Lk 18:16	But Jesus called them 2 himself, sayin’, "Allow da kids 2 come 2 me, n don’t forbid them, 4 2 such belongs da kingdom of God.
Lk 18:17	TBH, whoever doesn't welcome da kingdom of God like a yung kid will never enter into it." 

Lk 18:18	And a certain ruler asked him, sayin’, "Gud Teacher, by doin’ wut will i inherit lyf 4ever?"
Lk 18:19	And Jesus said 2 him, "Y do u call me gud? No 1 is gud except God alone.
Lk 18:20	U kno da rules: 'Don’t cheat, don’t murder, don’t steal, don’t give false testimony, honor yo dad n mom.'"
Lk 18:21	And he said, "All deez i’ve observed from my youth."
Lk 18:22	And when he heard dis, Jesus said 2 him, "U still lack 1 thang: Sell all dat u hav, n distribute da proceeds 2 da poor--n u will hav treasure in heaven--n come, follow me."
Lk 18:23	But when he heard deez tingz he became sad af, cuz he wuz extremely wealthy. 

Lk 18:24	And Jesus took notice of him n said, "How difficult it’s 4 those who possess wealth 2 enter into da kingdom of God!
Lk 18:25	Cuz it’s easier 4 a camel 2 go thru da eye of a needle than 4 a rich person 2 enter into da kingdom of God.
Lk 18:26	So those who heard dis said, "And who can be saved?"
Lk 18:27	But he said, "Wut is impossible w men is possible w God." 

Lk 18:28	And Pete said, "Look, we've left all dat’s ours n followed u."
Lk 18:29	And he said 2 them, "TBH there’s nobody who haz left house or wife or bros or parents or kids on account of da kingdom of God,
Lk 18:30	who won’t get many times more in dis time n in da age 2 come, lyf 4ever." 

Lk 18:31	And taking aside da 12, he said 2 them, "Look, we're goin’ up 2 Jerusalem, n all da tingz dat r written by da prophets w reference 2 da Son of Man gonna be accomplished.
Lk 18:32	Cuz he gonna be handed over 2 da Gentiles n gonna be roasted n mistreated n spit on,
Lk 18:33	n after whipping him they’ll kill him, n on da 3rd day he’ll rise."
Lk 18:34	And they understood none of deez tingz, n dis sayin’ wuz concealed from them, n they didn't comprehend da tingz dat were said. 

Lk 18:35	Now it happened dat as he drew near 2 Jericho, a certain blind man wuz sitting on da side of da road begging.
Lk 18:36	And when he heard a crowd goin’ by, he inquired wut dis meant.
Lk 18:37	And they told him, "Jesus da Nazarene is passing by."
Lk 18:38	And he called out, sayin’, "Jesus, Son of Dave, hav mercy on me!"
Lk 18:39	And those who were in front roasted him, dat he shud be silent, but he cried out even more loudly, "Son of Dave, hav mercy on me!"
Lk 18:40	So Jesus stopped n ordered him 2 be brought 2 him. And when he approached, he asked him,
Lk 18:41	"Wut do u want me 2 do 4 u?" And he said, "Lord, dat i may regain my sight.
Lk 18:42	And Jesus said 2 him, "Regain yo sight! Yo faith haz saved u."
Lk 18:43	And immediately he regained his sight n began 2 follow him, glorifying God. And all da ppl, when they saw it, gave praise 2 God. 


CHAPTER 19
Lk 19:1	And he entered n traveled thru Jericho.
Lk 19:2	And there wuz a man named Zacchaeus, n he wuz a chief tax collector, n he wuz rich.
Lk 19:3	And he wuz seeking 2 c Jesus--who he wuz--n he wasn’t able 2 as a result of da crowd, cuz he wuz short in stature.
Lk 19:4	And he ran on ahead n climbed up into a sycamore tree so dat he could c him, cuz he wuz goin’ 2 go thru dat wae.
Lk 19:5	And when he came 2 da place, Jesus looked up n said 2 him, "Zacchaeus, come down quickly, cuz it’s necessary 4 me 2 stay at yo house 2day!"
Lk 19:6	And he came down quickly n welcomed him joyfully.
Lk 19:7	And when they saw it, they all began 2 complain, sayin’, "He haz gone in 2 find lodging w a man who is a sinner!"
Lk 19:8	And Zacchaeus stopped n said 2 da Lord, "Look, half of my possessions, Lord, im giving 2 da poor, n if i’ve extorted anythin’ from anyone, im paying it back 4 times as much!"
Lk 19:9	And Jesus said 2 him, "2day salvation haz come 2 dis house, cuz he too is a son of Abe.
Lk 19:10	Cuz da Son of Man came 2 seek n 2 save those who r lost." 

Lk 19:11	Now while they were listening 2 deez tingz, he went on n told a parable, cuz he wuz near Jerusalem n they thought dat da kingdom of God wuz goin’ 2 appear immediately.
Lk 19:12	So he said, "A certain nobleman traveled 2 a distant country 2 get 4 himself a kingdom n 2 return.
Lk 19:13	And summoning 10 of his own slaves, he gave them 10 minas n said 2 them, 'Do business until i come back.'
Lk 19:14	But his citizens hated him, n sent a delegation after him, sayin’, 'We don’t want dis man 2 be king over us!'
Lk 19:15	And it happened dat when he returned after receiving da kingdom, he ordered deez slaves 2 whom he had given da money 2 be summoned 2 him, so dat he could kno wut they had gained by trading.
Lk 19:16	So da 1st arrived, sayin’, 'Sir, yo mina haz made 10 minas more!'
Lk 19:17	And he said 2 him, 'Well done, gud slave! Cuz u hav been faithful in a very smol thang, hav authority over 10 cities.'
Lk 19:18	And da 2nd came, sayin’, 'Sir, yo mina haz made 5 minas.'
Lk 19:19	So he said 2 dis 1 also, 'And u be over 5 cities.'
Lk 19:20	And anotha came, sayin’, 'Sir, look yo mina, which i had put away 4 safekeeping in a piece of cloth.
Lk 19:21	Cuz i wuz afraid of u, cuz u r a severe man--u withdraw wut u didn't deposit, n u reap wut u didn't sow!'
Lk 19:22	He said 2 him, 'By yo own words i’ll judge u, wicked slave! U knew dat im a severe man, withdrawing wut i didn't deposit n reaping wut i didn't sow.
Lk 19:23	And y did u not give my money 2 da bank, n i, when i returned, would’ve collected it w interest?'
Lk 19:24	And 2 da bystanders he said, 'Take away from him da mina n give it 2 da 1 who haz da 10 minas!'
Lk 19:25	And they said 2 him, 'Sir, he’s 10 minas.'
Lk 19:26	'i tell u dat 2 e’erybody who haz, more gonna be given. But from da 1 who doesn't hav, even wut he’s gonna be taken away.
Lk 19:27	But deez enemies of mine who didn't want me 2 be king over them--bring them here n slaughter them in my presence!'" 

Lk 19:28	And after he had said deez tingz, he traveled on ahead, goin’ up 2 Jerusalem.
Lk 19:29	And it happened dat when he drew near 2 Bethphage n Bethany, 2 da hill called da Mount of Olives, he sent 2 of da homies,
Lk 19:30	sayin’, 'Go into da village in front of u, in which as u enter u will find a colt tied, on which no person haz ever sat, n untie it n bring it.
Lk 19:31	And if anyone asks u, 'Y r u untying it?' u will say dis: 'Da Lord haz need of it.'"
Lk 19:32	So those who were sent went n found it just like he had told them.
Lk 19:33	And as they were untying da colt, its owners said 2 them, 'Y r u untying da colt?'
Lk 19:34	So they said, 'Da Lord haz need of it.'
Lk 19:35	And they brought it 2 Jesus, n throwing their cloaks on da colt, they put Jesus on it.
Lk 19:36	And as he wuz goin’ along, they were spreading out their cloaks on da road.
Lk 19:37	Now as he wuz drawing near by dis time 2 da descent from da Mount of Olives, da whole crowd of da homies began rejoicing 2 praise God w a loud voice 4 all da miracles dat they had seen,
Lk 19:38	sayin’, 
 "Blessed is da king, da 1 who comes in da name of da Lord! Pce in heaven n glory in da highest!"

Lk 19:39	And some of da Pharisees from da crowd said 2 him, "Teacher, roast yo homeboys!"
Lk 19:40	And he answered n said, "i tell u dat if deez keep silent, da stones will cri out!" 

Lk 19:41	And when he approached n saw da city, he cried over it,
Lk 19:42	sayin’, "If u had known on dis day--even u--da tingz dat make 4 pce! But now they’re hidden from yo eyes.
Lk 19:43	Cuz days will come on u n yo enemies will put up an embankment against u, n will surround u n press u hard from all directions.
Lk 19:44	And they’ll raze u 2 da ground, u n yo kids within u, n won’t leave a stone on a stone within u, cuz u didn't recognize da time of yo visitation." 

Lk 19:45	And he entered into da temple courts n began 2 drive out those who were selling,
Lk 19:46	sayin’ 2 them, "It’s written, 'And my house gonna be a house of prayer,' but u hav made it a cave of robbers!" 

Lk 19:47	And he wuz teaching every day in da temple courts, n da chief priests n da scribes n da most prominent men of da ppl were seeking 2 destroy him.
Lk 19:48	And they didn't find anythin’ they could do, cuz all da ppl were paying close attention 2 wut they were hearing from him. 


CHAPTER 20
Lk 20:1	And it happened dat on 1 of da days while he wuz teaching da ppl in da temple courts n proclaiming da gospel, da chief priests n da scribes approached together w da elders
Lk 20:2	n said, sayin’ 2 him, "Tell us, by wut authority u r doin’ deez tingz, or who is da 1 who gave u dis authority?
Lk 20:3	And he answered n said 2 them, "i also will ask u a question, n u tell me:
Lk 20:4	Da baptism of Johnny--wuz it from heaven or from men?
Lk 20:5	And they discussed dis w 1 anotha, sayin’, "If we say 'From heaven,' he’ll say, 'Y did u not believe him?'
Lk 20:6	But if we say, 'From men,' all da ppl will stone us 2 death, cuz they’re convinced dat Johnny wuz a prophet."
Lk 20:7	And they replied dat they didn't kno where 'twas from.
Lk 20:8	And Jesus said 2 them, "Neither will i tell u by wut authority im doin’ deez tingz." 

Lk 20:9	And he began 2 tell da ppl dis parable: "A man planted a vineyard, n leased it 2 tenant farmers, n went on a journey 4 a long time.
Lk 20:10	And at da proper time he sent a slave 2 da tenant farmers, so dat they’d give him some of da fruit of da vineyard. But da tenant farmers sent him away empty-handed after beating him.
Lk 20:11	And he proceeded 2 send anotha slave, but they beat n dishonored dat 1 also, n sent him away empty-handed.
Lk 20:12	And he proceeded 2 send a 3rd, but they wounded n yote out dis 1 also.
Lk 20:13	So da owner of da vineyard said, 'Wut shud i do? i’ll send my beloved son; maybe they’ll respeck him.'
Lk 20:14	But when da tenant farmers saw him, they began 2 reason w 1 anotha, sayin’, 'Dis is da heir. Let us kill him so dat da inheritance will become ours!'
Lk 20:15	And they yote him out of da vineyard n killed him. Wut then will da owner of da vineyard do 2 them?
Lk 20:16	He will come n destroy those tenant farmers n give da vineyard 2 others." And when they heard dis, they said, "May dis never happen!"
Lk 20:17	But he looked intently at them n said, "Wut then is dis dat’s written: 
 'Da stone which da builders rejected, dis haz become da cornerstone.'

Lk 20:18	E’erybody who falls on dat stone gonna be broken 2 pieces, n da 1 on whom it falls--it’ll crush him!"
Lk 20:19	And da scribes n da chief priests sought 2 lay their hands on him at dat same hr, n they were afraid of da ppl, 4 they knew dat he had told dis parable w reference 2 them. 

Lk 20:20	And they watched him closely n sent spies who pretended they were upright, so dat they could catch him in a statement, so dat they could hand him over 2 da authority n da jurisdiction of da governor.
Lk 20:21	And they asked him, sayin’, "Teacher, we kno dat u talk n teach rightly, n don’t show partiality, but teach da wey of God in truth.
Lk 20:22	Is it permitted 4 us 2 pay taxes 2 Caesar or not?"
Lk 20:23	But seeing thru their craftiness, he said 2 them,
Lk 20:24	"Show me a denarius! Whose image n inscription does it hav?" And they answered n said, "Caesar's."
Lk 20:25	So he said 2 them, "Well then, give 2 Caesar da tingz of Caesar, n 2 God da tingz of God!"
Lk 20:26	And they weren't able 2 catch him in a statement in da sight of da ppl, n shook at his answer, they became silent. 

Lk 20:27	Now some of da Sadducees--who deny dat there’s a resurrection--came up n asked him,
Lk 20:28	sayin’, "Teacher, Moe wrote 4 us if someone's bro dies having a wife, n dis man is without kids, dat his bro shud take da wife n dad descendants 4 his bro.
Lk 20:29	Now there were 7 bros, n da 1st took a wife n died without kids,
Lk 20:30	n da 2nd,
Lk 20:31	n da 3rd took her, n like dat also da 7 didn't leave kids n died.
Lk 20:32	Finally da woman also died.
Lk 20:33	So in da resurrection, da woman--whose wife will she be? Cuz da 7 had her as wife."
Lk 20:34	And Jesus said 2 them, "Da sons of dis age marry n r given in marriage,
Lk 20:35	but those who r considered worthy 2 attain 2 dat age n 2 da resurrection from da ded neither marry nor r given in marriage,
Lk 20:36	4 they aren’t even able 2 die any longer, cuz they’re like da angels n r sons of God, cuz they’re sons of da resurrection.
Lk 20:37	But dat da ded r raised, even Moe revealed in da passage 'bout da bush, when he calls da Lord da God of Abe n da God of Isaac n da God of Jake.
Lk 20:38	Now he’s not God of da ded, but of da livin’, 4 all live 2 him!"
Lk 20:39	And some of da scribes answered n said, "Teacher, u hav spoken well."
Lk 20:40	Cuz they no longer dared 2 ask him anythin’. 

Lk 20:41	But he said 2 them, "In wut sense do they say dat da Christ is Dave's son?
Lk 20:42	Cuz Dave himself says in da book of Psalms, 
 'Da Lord said 2 my Lord, "Sit at my right hand,
Lk 20:43	until i make yo enemies a footstool 4 yo feet." '

Lk 20:44	Dave so calls him 'Lord,' n how’s he his son?" 

Lk 20:45	And while all da ppl were listening, he said 2 da homeboys,
Lk 20:46	"Beware of da scribes, who like walking around in long robes n who luv greetings in da marketplaces n da best seats in da synagogues n da places of honor at banquets,
Lk 20:47	who devour da houses of widows n pray lengthy prayers 4 da sake of appearance. Deez will get more severe condemnation!" 


CHAPTER 21
Lk 21:1	And he looked up n saw da rich putting their gifts into da contribution box,
Lk 21:2	n he saw a certain poor widow putting in there 2 smol copper coins.
Lk 21:3	And he said, "TBH dis poor widow put in more than all of them.
Lk 21:4	Cuz deez all put gifts into da offering out of their abundance, but dis woman out of her poverty put in all da means of subsistence dat she had." 

Lk 21:5	And while some were talkin’ 'bout da temple, dat 'twas adorned w precious stones n votive offerings, he said,
Lk 21:6	"As 4 deez tingz dat u c--days will come in which not 1 stone gonna be left on anotha stone dat’ll not be yeeted down!" 

Lk 21:7	And they asked him, sayin’, "Teacher, when so will deez tingz happen, n wut gonna be da sign when deez tingz r 'bout 2 take place?"
Lk 21:8	And he said, Watch out dat u aren’t deceived! Cuz many will come in my name, sayin’, 'im he,' n 'Da time is near!' Don’t go after them!
Lk 21:9	And when u hear 'bout wars n insurrections, don’t be terrified, 4 deez tingz must happen 1st, but da end won’t be at once."
Lk 21:10	Then he said 2 them, "nation will rise up against nation n kingdom against kingdom.
Lk 21:11	There gonna be great earthquakes n famines n plagues in various places. There gonna be terrible sights n great signs from heaven. 

Lk 21:12	"But b4 all deez tingz, they’ll lay their hands on u n will persecute u, handing u over 2 da synagogues n prisons. U gonna be brought b4 kings n governors cuz of my name.
Lk 21:13	Dis will turn out 2 u 4 a time of witness.
Lk 21:14	So make up yo minds not 2 prepare in advance 2 talk in yo own defense,
Lk 21:15	cuz i’ll give u a mouth n wisdom dat all yo opponents won’t be able 2 resist or contradict.
Lk 21:16	And u gonna be handed over even by parents n bros n relatives n friends, n they’ll put 2 death some of u.
Lk 21:17	And u gonna be hated by all cuz of my name.
Lk 21:18	Even a hair of yo head will never die!
Lk 21:19	By yo patient endurance u will gain yo lives. 

Lk 21:20	"But when u c Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then kno dat its desolation haz come near.
Lk 21:21	Then those in Judea must flee 2 da mountains, n those inside it must depart, n those in da fields must not enter into it,
Lk 21:22	cuz deez r days of vengeance, so dat all da tingz dat r written can be fulfilled.
Lk 21:23	Woe 2 those who r preggers n 2 those who r nursing their babies in those days! Cuz there gonna be great distress on da earth n wrath against dis ppl,
Lk 21:24	n they’ll fall by da edge of da sword, n gonna be led captive into all da nations, n Jerusalem gonna be trampled down by da Gentiles until da times of da Gentiles r fulfilled. 

Lk 21:25	"And there gonna be signs in da sun n moon n stars, n on da earth distress of nations in perplexity from da noise of da sea n its surging,
Lk 21:26	ppl fainting from fear n expectation of wut is comin’ on da inhabited earth, 4 da powers of da heavens gonna be shaken.
Lk 21:27	And then they’ll c da Son of Man arriving in a cloud w power n great glory.
Lk 21:28	But when deez tingz begin 2 happen, stand up straight n raise yo heads, cuz yo redemption is drawing near!" 

Lk 21:29	And he told them a parable: "Look at da fig tree n all da trees.
Lk 21:30	When they put out foliage, now u c 4 yoselves n kno dat by dis time da summer is near.
Lk 21:31	So also u, when u c deez tingz happening, kno dat da kingdom of God is near.
Lk 21:32	TBH dis generation will never pass away until all tingz take place!
Lk 21:33	Heaven n earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away. 

Lk 21:34	"But take care 4 yoselves, lest yo hearts r weighed down w dissipation n drunkenness n da worries of daily lyf, n dat day come on u suddenly
Lk 21:35	like a trap. Cuz it’ll come on all who reside on da face of da whole earth.
Lk 21:36	But be alert at all times, praying dat u may hav strength 2 escape all deez tingz dat r goin’ 2 happen, n 2 stand b4 da Son of Man." 

Lk 21:37	So throughout da days he wuz teaching in da temple courts, n throughout da nights he wuz goin’ out n spending da night on da hill dat’s called da Mount of Olives.
Lk 21:38	And all da ppl were getting up very early in da mornin’ 2 come 2 him in da temple courts 2 listen 2 him. 


CHAPTER 22
Lk 22:1	Now da feast of Unleavened Bread (which is called Passover) wuz drawing near.
Lk 22:2	And da chief priests n da scribes were seeking how they could destroy him, cuz they were afraid of da ppl. 

Lk 22:3	And Satan entered into Judas, da 1 called Iscariot, who wuz of da numba of da 12.
Lk 22:4	And he went away n discussed w da chief priests n officers of da temple guard how he could betray him 2 them.
Lk 22:5	And they were delighted, n came 2 an agreement w him 2 give him money.
Lk 22:6	And he agreed, n began looking 4 a favorable opportunity 2 betray him 2 them apart from da crowd. 

Lk 22:7	And da day of da feast of Unleavened Bread came, on which 'twas necessary 4 da Passover lamb 2 be sacrificed.
Lk 22:8	And he sent Pete n Johnny, sayin’, "Go n prepare da Passover 4 us, so dat we may eat it.
Lk 22:9	So they said 2 him, "Where do u want us 2 prepare it?"
Lk 22:10	And he said 2 them, "Look, when u hav entered into da city, a man carrying a jar of water will meet u. Follow him into da house which he enters.
Lk 22:11	And u will tell da master of da house, 'Da Teacher says 2 u, "Where is da guest room where i may eat da Passover w my homeboys?" '
Lk 22:12	And he’ll show u a large furnished upstairs room. Make preparations there."
Lk 22:13	So they went n found everythin’ just like he had told them, n they prepared da Passover. 

Lk 22:14	And when da hr came, he reclined at da table, n da apostles w him.
Lk 22:15	And he said 2 them, "i’ve earnestly desired 2 eat dis Passover w u b4 i suffer.
Lk 22:16	Cuz i tell u dat i’ll not eat it until it’s fulfilled in da kingdom of God."
Lk 22:17	And he took in hand a cup, n after giving thanks he said, "Take dis n share it among yoselves.
Lk 22:18	Cuz i tell u, from now on i’ll not drink of da product of da vine until da kingdom of God comes." 

Lk 22:19	And he took bread, n after giving thanks, he broke it n gave it 2 them, sayin’, "Dis is my body which is given 4 u. Do dis in remembrance of me."
Lk 22:20	And in da same wey da cup after they had eaten, sayin’, "Dis cup is da new covenant in my blood which is poured out 4 u. 

Lk 22:21	"But look, da hand of da 1 who is betraying me is w me on da table!
Lk 22:22	Cuz da Son of Man is goin’ accordin’ 2 wut haz been determined, but woe 2 dat man by whom he’s betrayed!"
Lk 22:23	And they began 2 debate w 1 anotha who then of them it could be who wuz goin’ 2 do dis. 

Lk 22:24	And a dispute also occurred among them as 2 which of them wuz recognized as bein’ best.
Lk 22:25	So he said 2 them, "Da kings of da Gentiles lord it over them, n those who hav authority over them r called benefactors.
Lk 22:26	But u aren’t 2 be like dis! But da 1 who is best among u must become like da youngest, n da 1 who leads like da 1 who serves.
Lk 22:27	Cuz who is better, da 1 who reclines at da table or da 1 who serves? Is it not da 1 who reclines at da table? But im in yo midst as da 1 who serves. 

Lk 22:28	"And u r da ones who hav remained w me in my trials,
Lk 22:29	n i confer on u a kingdom, just like my Dad conferred on me,
Lk 22:30	dat u may eat n drink at my table in my kingdom, n u will sit on thrones judging da 12 tribes of Israel. 

Lk 22:31	"Simon, Simon, look, Satan haz demanded 2 sift u like wheat,
Lk 22:32	but i’ve prayed 4 u, dat yo faith may not fail. And u, when once u hav turned back, strengthen yo bros."
Lk 22:33	But he said 2 him, "Lord, im ready 2 go w u both 2 prison n 2 death!"
Lk 22:34	And he said, "i tell u, Pete, da rooster won’t crow 2day until u hav denied 3 times dat u kno me!" 

Lk 22:35	And he said 2 them, "When i sent u out without a money bag n a traveler's bag n sandals, u didn't lack anythin’, did u?" And they said, "Nothin’."
Lk 22:36	And he said 2 them, "But now da 1 who haz a money bag must take it, n like dat a traveler's bag. And da 1 who doesn't hav a sword must sell his cloak n buy 1.
Lk 22:37	Cuz i tell u dat dis dat’s written gotta be fulfilled in me: 'And he wuz counted w da criminals.' Cuz indeed, wut is written 'bout me is bein’ fulfilled."
Lk 22:38	So they said, "Lord, look, here r 2 swords!" And he said 2 them, "It’s aight." 

Lk 22:39	And he went away n proceeded, accordin’ 2 his custom, 2 da Mount of Olives, n da homies also followed him.
Lk 22:40	And when he came 2 da place, he said 2 them, "Pray dat u won’t enter into temptation."
Lk 22:41	And he withdrew from them 'bout a stone's yeet n knelt down n began 2 pray,
Lk 22:42	sayin’, "Dad, if u r willing, take away dis cup from me. Nevertheless, not wut i want but urs be done." [[
Lk 22:43	And an angel from heaven appeared 2 him, strengthening him.
Lk 22:44	And bein’ in anguish, he began praying more fervently n his sweat became like drops of blood falling down 2 da ground.]]
Lk 22:45	And when he got up from da prayer n came 2 da homeboys, he found them sleeping from sadness,
Lk 22:46	n he said 2 them, "Y r u sleeping? Get up n pray dat u won’t enter into temptation!" 

Lk 22:47	While he wuz still talkin’, look, there came a crowd, n da 1 named Judas, 1 of da 12, leading them. And he approached Jesus 2 kiss him.
Lk 22:48	But Jesus said 2 him, "Judas, r u betraying da Son of Man w a kiss?"
Lk 22:49	And when those around him saw wut wuz 'bout 2 happen, they said, "Lord, shud we hit w da sword?"
Lk 22:50	And a certain 1 of them struck da slave of da high priest n cut off his right ear.
Lk 22:51	But Jesus answered n said, "Stop! No more of dis!" And he touched his ear n healed him.
Lk 22:52	And Jesus said 2 da chief priests n officers of da temple n elders who had come out against him, "Hav u come out w swords n clubs, as against a robber?
Lk 22:53	Every day when i wuz w u in da temple courts, u didn't stretch out yo hands against me! But dis is yo hr n da domain of darkness!" 

Lk 22:54	And they arrested him n led him away n brought him into da house of da high priest. But Pete wuz following at a distance.
Lk 22:55	And when they had kindled a fire in da middle of da courtyard n sat down together, Pete sat down among them.
Lk 22:56	And a certain female slave, seeing him sitting in da light n looking intently at him, said, "Dis man also wuz w him!"
Lk 22:57	But he denied it, sayin’, "Woman, idk him!"
Lk 22:58	And after a short time anotha person saw him n said, "U also r 1 of them!" But Pete said, "Man, i ain’t!"
Lk 22:59	And after 'bout 1 hr had passed, someone else wuz insisting, sayin’, "In truth dis man also wuz w him, cuz he’s also a Galilean!"
Lk 22:60	But Pete said, "Man, idk wut u r talking 'bout!" And immediately, while he wuz still talkin’, a rooster crowed.
Lk 22:61	And da Lord turned around n looked intently at Pete. And Pete remembered da word of da Lord, how he said 2 him, "B4 da rooster crows 2day, u will deny me 3 times."
Lk 22:62	And he went outside n cried bitterly. 

Lk 22:63	And da men who were guarding him began 2 roast him while they beat him,
Lk 22:64	n after blindfolding him they repeatedly asked him, sayin’, "Prophesy! Who is da 1 who struck u?"
Lk 22:65	And they were sayin’ many other tingz against him, reviling him. 

Lk 22:66	And when day came, da council of elders of da ppl gathered, both chief priests n scribes, n they led him away 2 their Sanhedrin,
Lk 22:67	sayin’, "If u r da Christ, tell us!" But he said 2 them, "If i tell u, u will never believe,
Lk 22:68	n if i ask u, u will never answer!
Lk 22:69	But from now on da Son of Man gonna be seated at da right hand of da power of God."
Lk 22:70	So they all said, "R u then da Son of God?" And he said 2 them, "U say dat im."
Lk 22:71	And they said, "Y do we've need of further testimony? Cuz we ourselves hav heard it from his mouth!" 


CHAPTER 23
Lk 23:1	And da whole assembly of them rose up n brought him b4 Pilate.
Lk 23:2	And they began 2 accuse him, sayin’, "We hav found dis man misleading our nation n forbidding us 2 pay taxes 2 Caesar, n sayin’ he himself is Christ, a king!"
Lk 23:3	And Pilate asked him, sayin’, "R u da king of da Jews?" And he answered him n said, "U say so."
Lk 23:4	So Pilate said 2 da chief priests n da crowds, "i find no basis 4 an accusation against dis man."
Lk 23:5	But they insisted, sayin’, "He incites da ppl, teaching throughout da whole of Judea n beginning from Galilee as far as here." 

Lk 23:6	Now when Pilate heard dis, he asked if da man wuz a Galilean.
Lk 23:7	And when he found out dat he wuz from da jurisdiction of Herod, he sent him over 2 Herod, who wuz also in Jerusalem in those days.
Lk 23:8	And when Herod saw Jesus, he wuz glad af, 4 he had been wanting 2 c him 4 a long time, cuz he had heard 'bout him n wuz hoping 2 c some miracle performed by him.
Lk 23:9	So he questioned him at considerable length, but he answered nothin’ 2 him.
Lk 23:10	And da chief priests n da scribes were standing there vehemently accusing him.
Lk 23:11	And Herod w his soldiers also treated him w contempt, n after roasting him n dressing him in glistening clothing, he sent him back 2 Pilate.
Lk 23:12	And both Herod n Pilate became friends w 1 anotha on dat same day, 4 they had previously been enemies of 1 anotha. 

Lk 23:13	So Pilate called together da chief priests n da rulers n da ppl
Lk 23:14	n said 2 them, "U brought me dis man as 1 who wuz misleading da ppl, n look, when i examined him b4 u, i found nothin’ in dis man as basis 4 da accusation which u r making against him.
Lk 23:15	But neither did Herod, cuz he sent him back 2 us. And look, nothin’ deserving death haz been done by him.
Lk 23:16	So i’ll punish him n release him." 
Lk 23:18	But they all cried out in unison, sayin’, "Take dis man away, n release 4 us Barabbas!"
Lk 23:19	(who had been yeeted in jail cuz of a certain insurrection dat had taken place in da city, n 4 murder).
Lk 23:20	And Pilate, wanting 2 release Jesus, addressed them again,
Lk 23:21	but they kept crying out, sayin’, "Crucify! Crucify him!"
Lk 23:22	So he said 2 them a 3rd time, "Y? Wut wrong haz dis man done? i found no basis 4 an accusation deserving death in him. So i’ll punish him n release him."
Lk 23:23	But they were urgent, demanding w loud cries dat he be crucified. And their cries prevailed.
Lk 23:24	And Pilate decided dat their demand shud be granted.
Lk 23:25	And he released da 1 who had been yeeted into jail cuz of insurrection n murder, whom they were asking 4, but Jesus he handed over 2 their will. 

Lk 23:26	And as they led him away, they seized Simon, a certain man of Cyrene, who wuz comin’ from da country, n placed da cross on him, 2 carry it behind Jesus.
Lk 23:27	And a great crowd of da ppl were following him, n of women who were mourning n lamenting him.
Lk 23:28	But turning 2 them, Jesus said, "Daughters of Jerusalem, don’t cri 4 me, but cri 4 yoselves n 4 yo kids!
Lk 23:29	Cuz look, days r comin’ in which they’ll say, 'Blessed r da barren, n da wombs dat didn't give birth, n da breasts dat didn't nurse!'
Lk 23:30	Then they’ll begin 2 tell da mountains, 'Fall on us!' n 2 da hills, 'Cover us!'
Lk 23:31	Cuz if they do deez tingz when da wood is green, wut will happen when it’s dry?" 

Lk 23:32	And 2 other criminals were also led away 2 be executed w him.
Lk 23:33	And when they came 2 da place dat’s called "Da Skull," there they crucified him, n da criminals, da 1 on his right n da other on his left.
Lk 23:34	[But Jesus said, "Dad, forgive them, 4 they dunno wut they’re doin’."] And they cast lots 2 divide his clothes.
Lk 23:35	And da ppl stood there watching, but da rulers also made fun of him, sayin’, "He saved others; let him save himself, if dis man is da Christ of God, da Chosen 1!"
Lk 23:36	And da soldiers also roasted him, comin’ up n offering him sour wine
Lk 23:37	n sayin’, "If u r da king of da Jews, save yoself!"
Lk 23:38	And there wuz also an inscription over him, "Dis is da king of da Jews." 

Lk 23:39	And 1 of da criminals who were hanged there reviled him, sayin’, "R u not da Christ? Save yoself--n us!"
Lk 23:40	But da other answered n roasted him, sayin’, "Do u not even fear God, cuz u r undergoing da same condemnation?
Lk 23:41	And we indeed justly, 4 we're receiving wut we deserve 4 wut we've done. But dis man haz done nothin’ wrong!"
Lk 23:42	And he said, "Jesus, remember me when u come into yo kingdom!"
Lk 23:43	And he said 2 him, "TBH, 2day u gonna be w me in paradise." 

Lk 23:44	And by dis time 'twas 'bout da 6th hr, n darkness came over da whole land until da 9th hr
Lk 23:45	cuz da light of da sun failed. And da curtain of da temple wuz torn apart down da middle.
Lk 23:46	And Jesus, calling out w a loud voice, said, "Dad, into yo hands i entrust my spirit!" And after he said dis, he expired. 

Lk 23:47	Now when da centurion saw wut had happened, he began 2 praise God, sayin’, "Totally dis man wuz gud!"
Lk 23:48	And all da crowds dat had come together 4 dis spectacle, when they saw da tingz dat had happened, returned home beating their breasts.
Lk 23:49	And all his acquaintances, n da women who had followed him from Galilee who saw deez tingz, stood at a distance. 

Lk 23:50	And look, a man named Joey, who wuz a member of da council, a gud n gud man
Lk 23:51	(dis man wasn’t consenting 2 their plan n deed), from Arimathea, a Judean town, who wuz looking forward 2 da kingdom of God.
Lk 23:52	Dis man approached Pilate n asked 4 da body of Jesus.
Lk 23:53	And he took it down n wrapped it in a linen cloth n placed him in a tomb cut into da rock where nobody had ever been placed.
Lk 23:54	And 'twas da day of preparation, n da Sabbath wuz drawing near.
Lk 23:55	And da women who had been accompanying him from Galilee followed n saw da tomb n how his body wuz placed.
Lk 23:56	And they returned n prepared fragrant spices n perfumes, n on da Sabbath they rested accordin’ 2 da rule. 


CHAPTER 24
Lk 24:1	Now on da 1st day of da week, at very early dawn, they came back 2 da tomb bringing da fragrant spices which they had prepared.
Lk 24:2	And they found da stone had been rolled away from da tomb,
Lk 24:3	but when they went in, they didn't find da body.
Lk 24:4	And it happened dat while they were perplexed 'bout dis, look, 2 men in gleaming clothing stood near them.
Lk 24:5	And as they were terrified n bowed their faces 2 da ground, they said 2 them, "Y r u looking 4 da livin’ among da ded?
Lk 24:6	He isn’t here, but haz been raised! Remember how he spoke 2 u while he wuz still in Galilee,
Lk 24:7	sayin’ dat da Son of Man gotta be delivered into da hands of men who r sinners, n be crucified, n on da 3rd day rise?"
Lk 24:8	And they remembered his words,
Lk 24:9	n when they returned from da tomb, they reported all deez tingz 2 da 11 n 2 all da rest.
Lk 24:10	Now Mary Magdalene n Joanna n Mary da mom of James n da others w them were telling deez tingz 2 da apostles.
Lk 24:11	And deez words appeared 2 them as nonsense, n they refused 2 believe them.
Lk 24:12	But Pete got up n ran 2 da tomb, n bending over 2 look, he saw only da strips of linen cloth, n he went away 2 his home wondering wut had happened. 

Lk 24:13	And look, on dat same day, 2 of them were traveling 2 a village named Emmaus dat wuz sixty stadia distant from Jerusalem,
Lk 24:14	n they were conversing w 1 anotha 'bout all deez tingz dat had happened.
Lk 24:15	And it happened dat while they were conversing, n discussing, Jesus himself also approached n began 2 go along w them,
Lk 24:16	but their eyes were prevented from recognizing him.
Lk 24:17	And he said 2 them, "Wut r deez matters dat u r discussing w 1 anotha as u r walking along?" And they stood still, looking sad.
Lk 24:18	And 1 of them, named Cleopas, answered n said 2 him, "R u da only 1 livin’ near Jerusalem n not knowing da tingz dat hav happened in it in deez days?"
Lk 24:19	And he said 2 them, "Wut tingz?" So they said 2 him, "Da tingz abt Jesus da Nazarene, a man who wuz a prophet, powerful in deed n word b4 God n all da ppl,
Lk 24:20	n how our chief priests n rulers handed him over 2 a sentence of death, n crucified him.
Lk 24:21	But we were hoping dat he wuz da 1 who wuz goin’ 2 redeem Israel. But in addition 2 all deez tingz, dis is da 3rd day since deez tingz took place.
Lk 24:22	But also some women from among us shook us, who were at da tomb early in da mornin’,
Lk 24:23	n when they didn't find his body, they came back sayin’ they had seen even a vision of angels, who said dat he wuz alive!
Lk 24:24	And some of those w us went out 2 da tomb n found it like dis, just like da women had also said, but him they didn't c."
Lk 24:25	And he said 2 them, "O stupid n slow in heart 2 believe in all dat da prophets hav spoken!
Lk 24:26	Wuz it not necessary dat da Christ suffer deez tingz n enter into his glory?"
Lk 24:27	And beginning from Moe n from all da prophets, he interpreted 2 them da tingz abt himself in all da scriptures.
Lk 24:28	And they drew near 2 da village where they were goin’, n he acted as though he wuz goin’ farther.
Lk 24:29	And they urged him strongly, sayin’, "Stay w us, cuz it’s getting toward evening, n by dis time da day is far spent." And he went in 2 stay w them.
Lk 24:30	And it happened dat when he reclined at da table w them, he took da bread n gave thanks, n after breaking it, he gave it 2 them.
Lk 24:31	And their eyes were opened, n they recognized him, n he became invisible 2 them.
Lk 24:32	And they said 2 1 anotha, "Were not our hearts burning within us while he wuz talkin’ w us on da road, while he wuz explaining da scriptures 2 us?"
Lk 24:33	And they got up dat same hr n returned 2 Jerusalem n found da 11 n those w them assembled,
Lk 24:34	sayin’, "Da Lord haz rly been raised, n haz appeared 2 Simon!"
Lk 24:35	And they began describing wut happened on da road, n how he wuz recognized by them in da breaking of da bread. 

Lk 24:36	And while they were sayin’ deez tingz, he himself stood there among them.
Lk 24:37	But they were startled n became terrified, n thought they had seen a ghost.
Lk 24:38	And he said 2 them, "Y r u frightened? And 4 wut reason do doubts arise in yo hearts?
Lk 24:39	Look at my hands n my feet, dat im i myself! Touch me n c, cuz a ghost doesn't hav flesh n bones, as u c dat i’ve."
Lk 24:40	And when he had said dis, he showed them his hands n his feet.
Lk 24:41	And while they were still disbelieving cuz of happiness n were marveling, he said 2 them, "Do u hav anythin’ 2 eat here?"
Lk 24:42	So they gave him a piece of broiled fish,
Lk 24:43	n he took it n ate it in front of them. 

Lk 24:44	And he said 2 them, "Deez r my words dat i spoke 2 u while i wuz still w u, dat everythin’ dat’s written 'bout me in da law of Moe n da prophets n psalms gotta be fulfilled."
Lk 24:45	Then he opened their minds 2 understand da scriptures,
Lk 24:46	n said 2 them, "So it’s written dat da Christ would suffer n would rise from da ded on da 3rd day,
Lk 24:47	n repentance n da forgiveness of sins would be proclaimed in his name 2 all da nations, beginning from Jerusalem.
Lk 24:48	U r witnesses of deez tingz.
Lk 24:49	And look, im sending out wut wuz promised by my Dad on u, but u stay in da city until u r clothed w power from on high." 

Lk 24:50	And he led them out as far as Bethany, n lifting up his hands, he blessed them.
Lk 24:51	And it happened dat while he wuz blessing them, he parted from them n wuz taken up into heaven.
Lk 24:52	And they worshiped him n returned 2 Jerusalem w great happiness.
Lk 24:53	And they were continually in da temple courts praising God.
